<h2 id="Preface">PREFACE</h2>

<p>
<span class="begc">The</span> present volume contains a collection of
essays, the majority of which were read as papers
before various literary societies, such as the International
Congress of Orientalists, the Biblical
Archaeological Society, and the Jews' College
Literary Association. Several of them have already
appeared in various periodicals, such as the <i>Imperial
Asiatic Review</i>, the <i>Jewish Quarterly Review</i>, and
the <i>Jewish Chronicle</i>, and are now reproduced, with
some slight modification, by the courtesy of the
editors. Translations of some of the essays have
also been published in Hebrew, French, and German
periodicals.
</p>

<p>
The essays, it may be remarked, deal somewhat
extensively with the humour and satire that is not
infrequently to be found in the works both of
ancient and modern Hebrew writers; and, as this
subject has hitherto attracted but little attention,
I am not without hope that these pages may be of
interest to the general reader.

<span class="subtitle">
<a href="#toc-return-I">HUMOUR OF THE BIBLE</a></span></h2>

<p>
<span class="begc">The</span> Hebrew Bible rightly deserves to be termed the
Book of Books in the world of letters: it is distinguished
from other literary productions by the richness of its
sentences, its charm of style and diction, its pathos, and
also by the flashes of genuine humour, which here and there
illuminate its pages. Naturally its humour differs materially
from the broad, rich humour of Sterne, Cervantes, Voltaire
or Heine, but it has a stamp of its own, which is in some
respects akin to that found in certain passages of the
ancient classics. One or two examples will serve.
</p>

<p>
In the first book of the <i>Iliad</i>, Homer describes a scene
on Mount Olympus, in which the Greek gods and goddesses
are represented as seated at a banquet, and waited upon
by the lame Hephaestus. Observing his halting gait, they
burst into peals of laughter. Comparable, perhaps, with
this is the description of the well-known scene on Mount
Carmel, when Elijah, the true prophet of God, gathered
round him the false prophets of Baal. After they had leapt
on the altar from morning unto even, crying incessantly,
“Oh, Baal, hear us,” Elijah stepped forth, and exclaimed
mockingly, “Cry ye louder, for he is a god; perhaps he
talketh or walketh, or is on a journey; or peradventure he
sleepeth and must be awaked” (1 Kings xviii. 27). The
Aristophanic punning on proper names is paralleled not
infrequently in the Bible. Thus, for example, the Hebrew
word <i>Nabal</i> (1 Sam. xxv. 3), which means “rogue,” is
well applied as the proper name of a man, who was noted
for the baseness of his character. Characteristic, too, is the
name of one of Job's fair daughters, <i>Keren-happuch</i>
(Job xlii. 14), which literally means “a horn (or box) of
cosmetics,” suggesting the means by which the owner of
<span class="pageno target" title="2" id="page-2"></span>
that name may occasionally have embellished her charms.
To the same class belongs the term <i>Tsara</i>
(<span class="heb" title="tsara" xml:lang="he">צרה</span>), which
has the double designation of “a rival wife,” living in
a country where polygamy is in vogue, and also of
“misery.” The humour hidden in these three words is
certainly not brought into prominence in the authorized
English version, where they are respectively translated by
“folly,” “Keren-happuch,” and “adversary.” From these
examples it will be seen that an acquaintance with the
idiom of the Hebrew tongue is essential to the thorough
understanding of the Bible, and as Biblical critics have
hitherto paid but little attention to this particular subject,
the remarks to be offered on it in the present essay may,
perhaps, be of some interest.
</p>

<p>
A careful perusal, in the original Hebrew of certain
orations in the Bible cannot fail to impress the reader with
the force of the sarcasm which the authors, acting on the
proverb, <i>Castigare ridendo mores</i>, have used in their
attacks on the shortcomings and follies of their own, and
sometimes also of other nations, with whom they happened
to come into political contact. The greatest satirist among
them was undoubtedly the prophet Isaiah, whose orations
combine the pungency of satire with the charm of an
exquisite poetical style. Somewhat in the manner of
Demosthenes and Cicero, Isaiah often wages war against
the vices which prevailed among the higher and lower
classes of his people. He frequently derides princes and
leaders for not preserving and upholding that true spirit
of patriotism, which generally helps to make a country
secure from external invasion. “Ye are,” he exclaims with
bitter irony, “Ye are only <i>mighty to drink wine</i>, and men
of <i>strength</i> to pour out <i>strong drinks</i>” (Isa. v. 22). Isaiah's
orations frequently contain graphic and satirical descriptions
of how things will be when that fatal day—the <i>dies irae</i>,
<i>dies illa</i>—comes, on which the enemy will reign supreme
within the capital of the Judaeans, bringing with them the
suffering of famine, sickness, and pestilence. These poorly
<span class="pageno target" title="3" id="page-3"></span>
clad and careworn men will surround the lucky owner of
a decent garment, saying: “Thou hast still clothing, be
thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thine hand.”
But he will decline the proffered honour with the humiliating
remark: “I will <i>not</i> be an healer; for in my house is neither
bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people”
(ibid. iii. 6 and 7). The then prevailing need and distress
will not be less felt by the Jewish women, most of whom
the disastrous war will have deprived of their husbands
and natural protectors. The consequence of this will be
that “On that day <i>seven</i> women will take hold of <i>one</i> man,
saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own
apparel: only let us be called by thy name, and thus take
away our reproach” (ibid. iv. 1).
</p>

<p>
The extravagance, wantonness, and luxurious habits of
the fair daughters of Zion, Isaiah denounces in the following
drastic lines:—“Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,
and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton (or, deceiving<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor"><sup>[3-1]</sup></a>)
eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making
a tinkling with their feet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it shall come to pass that
instead of sweet smell there shall be bad odour, and
instead of a girdle a rent, and burning instead of beauty”
(ibid. iii. 16–24). And just as Isaiah reproves the Hebrew
women for their pride and arrogance, so he censures the
cowardice and effeminate habits of the men of Zion, whose
motto, he says, was “Let us eat and drink; for to-morrow
we die” (ibid. xxii. 13).
</p>

<p>
The burlesquing of idols and idolatry always afforded
a ready mark for the sarcasm of the prophets. As Aristophanes
in <i>The Birds</i> ridicules the Greek gods and
goddesses, so Isaiah satirizes the sham gods of <i>his</i> country,
which were held in great estimation by not a few of his own
people. His description of the origin and manufacture of
an idol is certainly full of humour. “He” (the pious
idolater) “heweth down a tree (he says) and burneth part
<span class="pageno target" title="4" id="page-4"></span>
thereof in a fire; one part serves him as firewood, by means
of which he roasteth meat and is satisfied; yea, he warmeth
himself therewith, and saith: Aha, I am warm; I have
seen the fire. And out of the residue thereof he maketh
a god, even his graven image: he falleth down before it,
and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith: Deliver
me, for thou art my god” (ibid. xliv. 14–17).
</p>

<p>
With equal humour Isaiah makes merry over the false
prophets of Israel, whom he compares to blind watchmen
and to dumb dogs. “His (Israel's) watchmen,” he says,
“are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs,
they cannot even bark; they lie down as if dreaming, and
are fond of slumber” (ibid. lvi. 10).
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the butt of Isaiah's sarcasm were persons of
high standing, who belonged to nationalities other than his
own, such as the Babylonians, the Egyptians, the Moabites,
and others. Highly diverting is the sarcastic address which
he directed to one of the Babylonian kings who, after
making an unsuccessful attempt to conquer Palestine, had
been ignominiously defeated in his own country. It is to
be found in the fourteenth chapter of Isaiah, a short extract
from which runs as follows:—“The whole earth is now
(after thy fall) at rest and quiet; people break forth into
singing. Yea, even the fir-trees rejoice at thee, and the
cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since thou art laid down, no
feller is come up against us. Hell from beneath is astir at
thy coming; it rouseth up the dead for thee, even all the
chief ones of the earth; it has raised up from their thrones
all the kings of the nations. All they shall speak and say
unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou
become like unto us? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. how art thou fallen from heaven,
O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down
to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!”
</p>

<p>
In an equally amusing and drastic manner is Babylon's
fall described by Isaiah. “And Babylon,” he says, “the
glory of the kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency,
shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and
<span class="pageno target" title="5" id="page-5"></span>
Gomorrah .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. neither shall the Arabian pitch his tent
there, nor shall the shepherds make their fold in that place.
But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their
houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall
dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there. And the wild
beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and
dragons in their pleasant places” (ibid. xiii. 19–23).
</p>

<p>
Next to Isaiah, no other author of any part of the Bible
is so prolific of satirical remarks as the author of the Book
of Ecclesiastes. For the present purpose it matters very
little whether the writer of the book in question was King
Solomon, to whom the authorship of the Book of Proverbs
is commonly ascribed, or some one unknown, who had
assumed the pseudonym of “Koheleth.” But this is certain
that he does not belong to that class of writers whose
humour is but a mixture of bitterness and melancholy,
and who, like the authors of <i>Faust</i> and <i>Manfred</i>, speak
bitingly of humanity at large. His humour is mostly of
the cheerful order; and far from weeping over the foibles
and follies of the human race, he makes merry over them.
The gist of his philosophy may be said to be embodied in
that frequently quoted line from Amphis (<i>Gynaecocratia</i>,
p. 481), which runs thus:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">
<span xml:lang="grc" title="Pine, paize; thnêtos ho bios.">Πῖνε, παῖζε· θνητὸς ὁ βίος.</span></p>
    <p class="verse">
<span xml:lang="grc" title="oligos houpi gê chronos">ὀλίγος οὑπὶ γῇ χρόνος</span>
</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
(Drink and chaff, for life is fleeting; short is our time on
earth). Or, to quote Koheleth's own words: “Behold that
which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat
and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all the labour that
he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God
giveth him: for this alone is his portion” (Eccles. v. 17).
</p>

<p>
The objects of Koheleth's satire are of a varied description.
High functionaries of state, foolish kings, scribblers, tedious
preachers, bookworms, idlers, sceptics, fools, drunkards,
women—they all come under his scrutiny. His sympathies
are always with the poor, helpless, and oppressed, rather
than for the rich and affluent, whose “abundance of wealth
<span class="pageno target" title="6" id="page-6"></span>
does not suffer them to sleep<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor"><sup>[6-1]</sup></a>.” Koheleth once met a poor
man, who had long and vainly tried to obtain, in the High
Court of Justice, redress for wrongs done to him, and he
put down in writing: “If thou seest oppression of the
poor, and violence done to justice and righteousness in the
provinces, do not feel astonished at that: for one that is
high watches over the high, and over them are yet higher
ones” (Eccles. v. 7). Elsewhere he condemns a land, “whose
king is childish, and whose princes <i>feast</i> already in the
<i>morning</i>,” but he praises such a one “whose princes eat at
a proper time for <i>strengthening</i> sake, and not for the sake
of <i>gluttony</i>” (ibid. x. 16, 17). In the same chapter (5, 7)
he makes the following ironical remark: “There is an evil
which I have seen under the sun: <i>folly</i> is set in <i>high
places</i>, and the rich (in intellect) <i>sit</i> in <i>lowness</i>. I have
seen <i>servants</i> on <i>horses</i>, and <i>princes walking like servants</i>
on the <i>ground</i>.”
</p>

<p>
What Koheleth thought of scribblers and tedious preachers
may be gathered from the following: “But more than all
these, my son, take warning for thyself: avoid the writing
of endless books, as well as much (dull) preaching, which is
a weariness of the flesh” (ibid. xii. 12). The bookworm,
too, was no great favourite of his, for he refers to him with,
as it were, a pitiful smile: “Where there is much study,
there is much vexation, and he that increases knowledge,
increases pain” (ibid. i. 18). And again: “The wise have
(as a rule) no bread, nor the man of understanding riches,
nor the man of knowledge power” (ibid. ix. 11).
</p>

<p>
Women were to some poets of antiquity, just as they are
to many a writer of modern times, a favourite subject for
sarcasm, and Koheleth has also made a few remarks about
them which, in point of satire, resemble somewhat those
made by Hesiod, Simonides, and others. Though he does
not compare woman to a hog, an ape, and an ass, as several
ancient writers have done, yet the opinion he expresses
about a certain class of women is by no means flattering
<span class="pageno target" title="7" id="page-7"></span>
to the fair sex generally. “I find,” he says, “more bitter
than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and
whose hands are bonds: he that is deemed good before
God will escape from her; but the sinner will be caught by
her.” And again: “<i>One</i> (perfect) <i>man</i> among a thousand
did I find; but <i>one</i> perfect <i>woman</i> among all these did
I <i>not</i> find” (ibid. vii. 26 and 28). In the Book of Proverbs,
which is commonly ascribed to the same author, there are
several references to women, in one of which a quarrelsome
woman is compared to “the continual downpour on a very
rainy day.” The husband of such a woman, the author
adds, would as little succeed in hiding his wife from the
outer world, as if he were trying “to hide a <i>wind</i>, or the
<i>perfume</i> of scented oil” (ibid, xxvii. 15, 16).
</p>

<p>
In the same book (xxiii. 29–35) there is a humorous
description of a drunkard, which ought not to be omitted,
when examples are quoted to prove the existence of light
humour in the Bible. It runs as follows: “Who hath woe?
who hath pain? who hath babbling? who hath wounds
without cause? who hath redness of the eyes? They that
tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed drinks.
. . . Thine eyes shall behold strange things, and thine heart
shall utter nonsensical words. Yea, thou shalt be as one
that lieth down in the midst of the sea, as one that reposeth
on the top of a mast. Oh, how they have stricken me (thou
shalt say), how they have beaten me, and I felt not; when
shall I awake? I shall yet seek it (the drink) again.”
</p>

<p>
The greatest satirists among the minor prophets of the
Bible were Hosea and Amos, and their short orations abound
in flashes of rich humour and biting sarcasm. The former,
for instance, when reproaching his people with their faithlessness
to their God and their king, remarks sarcastically:
“For now they say, We have no king; as we were not
(even) afraid of God, what can a (mortal) king do to us?”
(Hos. x. 3). Whatever they did under the pretension of
honouring God was, in Hosea's opinion, nothing but hypocrisy,
for “although Israel has forgotten his maker, yet he
<span class="pageno target" title="8" id="page-8"></span>
<i>buildeth temples</i>” (ibid. viii. 14). Those of his people,
who fancied they would obtain atonement for their sins by
merely offering sacrifices, he derided, saying: “They sacrifice
<i>flesh</i> for the sacrifices, and <i>eat</i> it (themselves)” (ibid.
viii. 13).
</p>

<p>
On another occasion, Hosea ridicules certain persons who,
like the inhabitants of Samaria, worshipped the <i>calves</i> of
<i>Beth-aven</i>, though they were otherwise not very anxious to
uphold and respect the common rights of man. And referring
to them, he says with biting irony: “Concerning
them, one may (aptly) say, They slaughter <i>man</i>, but kiss
the <i>calves</i>” (ibid. xiii. 2)<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor"><sup>[8-1]</sup></a>. Continuing to deride those
credulous men, who expect pardon for their sins by the
offer of sacrifices, Hosea remarks with crushing sarcasm:
“I desire mercy, and not sacrifices; and the knowledge of
God, more than burnt offerings” (ibid. vi. 6)<a id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor"><sup>[8-2]</sup></a>.
</p>

<p>
One would have expected that the priests at least would
set a good example to the people; but they were as bad as
the people themselves. “They were <i>eating up</i> the sin
offerings of the people, and looked out even longingly for
their (the people's) iniquity” (ibid. iv. 8), so that they might
materially profit by it. Speaking of the king and the ruler
of the people, Hosea considered him not a bit better than
his profligate courtiers, who spent the greater part of the
day in feasting and debauchery. There was especially no
end to their orgies at the celebration of the king's birthday,
and the same prophet described their behaviour on that day
in the following sarcastic terms: “It is our king's day!
The princes are already sick with the fever of wine; he
himself (meaning the king) stretches out his hands with the
scoffers” (ibid. vii. 5).
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="9" id="page-9"></span>
</div>

<p>
Amos, too, makes a good many droll remarks on the follies
and misdoings of his people. Addressing the fat judges of
the people of Samaria, who were noted for their pompous
gravity and effeminate habits, he calls them, most appropriately,
“kine of Bashan<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor"><sup>[9-1]</sup></a>.” These worthies were always
thirsty; and their constant cry when dealing with the
poor was: “Provide for us that we may have something
to drink” (Amos iv. 1). The patricians of his people followed
the bad example of the judges. They lived an easy
and luxurious life, indifferent to the approaching common
danger with which they were threatened—the loss of their
freedom and independence. Speaking of them, Amos says
bitterly: “Woe to them that put off the evil day, and
cause the seat of violence to come near, that lie upon beds
of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
that sing to the sound of the harp; they invent for themselves
instruments of music like David; that drink wine
out of bowls, and anoint themselves with the best ointments,
but are not grieved for the ruin of Joseph (Israel).
Therefore now shall they go <i>at the head</i> of the captives”
(ibid. vi. 4–7).
</p>

<p>
The hypocrites among his people, who, notwithstanding
their dishonest dealings with their neighbours, were exceedingly
strict in their observances of the holy seasons
appointed by the Jewish law, were rebuked by Amos in the
following manner: “Hear ye,” he says, “that swallow up
the needy, and destroy the poor of the land, saying, When
will the new moon be over, that we may sell again corn?
and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the
<i>ephah small</i> and the <i>shekel great</i>, and <i>falsifying</i> the balances
for <i>deceit</i>? That we may buy the poor for money, and the
needy for a pair of shoes; yea, and sell even the <i>refuse</i> of
the wheat?” (ibid. viii. 4–6).
</p>

<p>
These quotations may have already sufficiently supported
the argument stated in the introduction to this essay concerning
the existence of genuine humour in the Bible.
<span class="pageno target" title="10" id="page-10"></span>
The following are intended to show that even some of the
most austere Biblical personages, such, for instance, as the
prophets Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Moses himself, possessed
a vein of light humour, which they sometimes used with
considerable effect.
</p>

<p>
Jeremiah addresses the hypocrites among his people in
the following caustic terms: “How, will you steal, murder,
and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense,
and walk after other gods whom you know not; and (then)
come and stand before me in this house, which is called by
my name, and say, We are <i>now delivered to do all these
abominations</i>? Is this <i>house</i>, which is called by my name,
become a <i>den</i> of <i>robbers</i> in your eyes?” (Jer. vii. 9).
</p>

<p>
He elsewhere recommends his people to try an experiment
in the streets of Jerusalem, which, by a curious coincidence,
was once put into practice by the Greek philosopher
Diogenes, who went about the streets of Athens in the daytime
carrying a lighted lantern in his hand in search of
a <i>perfect man</i>, saying: “Run ye to and fro through the
streets of Jerusalem, and seek in the broad places thereof,
if you can find a (perfect) man .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if there be any that
seeketh the truth, and I shall pardon it” (ibid. v. 1).
</p>

<p>
The idols, the great plague of Judaea, also received at
this great prophet's hand their proper share of ridicule.
He describes them with genuine humour, as follows: “They
are upright as the palm-tree, but speak not; they must
needs be <i>borne</i>, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of
them, for they cannot do any <i>evil</i>, neither can they effect
any <i>good</i>” (ibid. x. 5).
</p>

<p>
Of Ezekiel's humour no specimens can be given here. It
is, like Swift's, rather coarse, and not altogether palatable.
The curious may be referred to the sixteenth and twenty-third
chapters of the Book of Ezekiel.
</p>

<p>
Moses, though of stern and austere disposition, is also
sometimes fond of indulging in ironical remarks with pleasing
propriety. So, for instance, when he once admonished
his people to give the soil of their possession a year of rest
<span class="pageno target" title="11" id="page-11"></span>
periodically, he gave them at the same time to understand
that unless they did so willingly, they would have to do it
later on by the force of circumstances. “When,” he says,
“you shall be in your enemies' land, <i>then</i> shall the land <i>rest</i>
and enjoy her sabbath” (Lev. xxvi. 34). And again: “Because
thou didst not serve <i>the Lord thy God</i> with joyfulness
and with gladness of heart, while there was (around) an
abundance of all things; therefore shalt thou serve <i>thy
enemies</i>, whom the Lord shall send out against thee, in
hunger, in thirst, in nakedness, and <i>in want of everything</i>”
(Deut. xxviii. 47, 48). The messengers sent out by Moses to
search the land of Canaan are reported by him (Num. xiii.
32) to have given the following description of it: “It is,”
they said, “a land that <i>eateth up</i> its own inhabitants,”
a sufficiently ironical definition.
</p>

<p>
In his last famous address to his people, which is
commonly called his swan-song, Moses recalled to their
mind the happy days, when God led them “as the eagle
stirreth up his nest, fluttereth over his young, spreadeth
abroad his wings, seizeth them, beareth them aloft on his
pinions” (Deut. xxxii 11–13). But at the same time he
foresaw with the far-seeing eye of a prophet, that, as soon
as they will have grown “<i>fat</i>, <i>thick</i>, and <i>fleshy</i>” they would
forsake the God of their fathers, and worship idols. And,
in consequence, he gives them God's divine message, which
is couched in the following sarcastic terms: “They have
moved me to jealousy with that which is <i>not God</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
I will provoke them to anger by a roguish nation” (ibid.
xxxii. 21).
</p>

<p>
There are a good many more fragments of delightful
humour to be found in the Bible, which, for lack of
space, must be omitted here. Yet a brief reference should
be made to some of the witty puns and plays on words
(<i>ludus verborum</i>, or <i>Wortspiele</i>) that occur in the same
sacred volume. In his well-known short poetical strain
(comp. Book of Judges xv. 16), Samson, the noted wit
of the Bible, purposely uses, as it would seem, the Hebrew
<span class="pageno target" title="12" id="page-12"></span>
term <i>Chamor</i> (<span class="heb" title="chamor" xml:lang="he">חמור</span>),
because it has two meanings, namely,
an <i>ass</i> and a <i>heap</i>. The humour of the Hebrew lines in
question will at once be noticeable by the following
rendering of them:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">With the jaw-bone of an ass</p>
    <p class="verse">Have I plenteous asses slain:</p>
    <p class="verse">Smitten thus it came to pass</p>
    <p class="verse">Fell a thousand on the plain.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
A good pun may also be detected in the word <i>Ro</i>pheïm
(physicians) and <i>Re</i>phaïm, which latter word signifies
“corpses”; or in <span class="heb" title="shophet" xml:lang="he">שׁפֵט</span>
“a judge,”
and <span class="heb" title="tipesh" xml:lang="he">טִפֵּשׁ</span>, meaning
“the stupid one.” Such and similar puns abound in the
Bible as well as in the Talmud, as, for instance, the phrase
found in the latter work:
<span class="heb" title="ekhol batsel veshev betsel" xml:lang="he">אֱכוֹל בָּצֵל וְשֵׁב בְּצֵל</span>
“Be satisfied
with a <i>meal</i> of <i>onions</i>, and enjoy living under the <i>shadow</i>
of thy own trees” (comp. Talmud, <i>Babyl. Pesachim</i>, 114 <i>a</i>);
but no further specimens can be given here.
</p>

<p>
These remarks will, it is hoped, help to show the wealth
of hidden meaning contained in the Bible, which can only
be detected by the study of the original Hebrew text, and
which the translators, either through oversight or inability,
have failed to reproduce.

<span class="subtitle">
<a href="#toc-return-II">THE BIBLE AND THE ANCIENT CLASSICS</a></span></h2>

<p>
<span class="begc">For</span> several centuries past,
previous to the middle of the
eighteenth century, a general notion used to prevail that
the contents of the Hebrew Bible consisted entirely of
purely theological matter. This idea originated from the
circumstance that most of the commentators of the Bible
living in those times had treated it as a book that was
full of religious mysticism, which theory had commonly
been accepted by their readers as the only correct and
plausible one.
</p>

<p>
These commentators have gone so far as to declare most
emphatically that even the “Song of Songs,” that masterpiece
of Hebrew poetry, and one of the few ancient literary
gems extant in the world of letters, was but a mystical
allegory with much religious colouring about it. They thus
altogether ignored its many poetical charms, just as they
disregarded those to be met with here and there in other
parts of the Bible. Fortunately, however, a book appeared
about the middle of the eighteenth century, which brought
about a great modification in these ideas. It contained
a number of lectures which Bishop Lowth (1710–87) had
delivered in Latin at the University of Oxford on “Ancient
Hebrew Poetry<a id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor"><sup>[13-1]</sup></a>,” and in which he essayed to prove that
the Old Testament contained, besides much theological
matter, several other highly interesting things. In his
opinion its contents were of a varied description, and of
such a nature that they could not fail to attract the attention
of religiously inclined people, as well as of all those
readers who had a taste for poetry, history, philosophy,
or oratory.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="14" id="page-14"></span>
</div>

<p>
These lectures at once attained great popularity, and were
eagerly read in England and on the Continent, so much
so that the ideas expressed therein concerning the actual
contents of the Bible were soon adopted and further enlarged
upon by several English and foreign Biblical scholars.
Some of them, and more especially Herder (1744–1803)
and Sir William Jones (1746–94), devoted their earnest
attention to the study of the sacred volume. Sir William,
who was one of the most eminent Orientalists of the day,
wrote about it as follows: “I have regularly and attentively
perused the Old Testament, and am of opinion that
this book, independently of its divine origin, contains
more true sublimity, more exquisite beauty, more important
history, and finer strains of poetry and eloquence
than can be collected from all other books that may have
been written<a id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor"><sup>[14-1]</sup></a>.” One of the most interesting parts of
Bishop Lowth's book is that which deals with the metaphors
and similes of the Hebrew Bible, and the object of the
present essay is to attempt to show that there is a striking
similarity between them and several of those employed
by some of the classical writers. As the subject is too
extensive to be fully discussed within the limits of a short
essay, a radical and minute investigation cannot be expected.
The result, however, may be sufficient to conduce
to a wider and more careful study of the contents of
the Bible in their relation to the ancient classics.
</p>

<p>
At the outset, it will be necessary to show that the
ancient Greeks and Romans had come in contact with the
Hebrews of old, and that they thus may have had an opportunity
of getting to know something about the existence
and the contents of the Bible. Now, in the latter volume,
as well as in Josephus (comp. Gen. x. 2–5; Isa. lxvi. 19;
Josephus, <i>Apion</i>, i. 22), this intercourse is fully recorded
as an historical fact. Particularly interesting is the passage
in the Book of Joel (iv. 6), in which it is stated that
<span class="pageno target" title="15" id="page-15"></span>
the Ionian Greeks living on the west coast of Asia Minor
(<span xml:lang="grc" title="Iônia">Ἰωνία</span>) were in the habit of buying Hebrew slaves. Thus
it is a curious coincidence that the district is commonly
known as the very place in which the two most famous
epic songs of the ancient Greeks, the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>,
were written<a id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor"><sup>[15-1]</sup></a>.
</p>

<p>
As regards the Romans, there are likewise certain historical
records which go to show that in the year 50 <span class="bc">A. D.</span>
they had already swayed the sceptre over the Hebrews.
There are, moreover, several allusions to them in the
works of some of the best-known Roman writers, such as
Tacitus<a id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor"><sup>[15-2]</sup></a>, Cicero<a id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor"><sup>[15-3]</sup></a>, Juvenal<a id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor"><sup>[15-4]</sup></a>, Horace<a id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor"><sup>[15-5]</sup></a>, and others. Now,
if in addition to these facts, another important circumstance
is taken into consideration, namely, that the famous
Greek translation of the Bible, called the <i>Septuagint</i>, had in
olden times circulated widely in various countries, what
objection can be raised to the assumption that it attracted
the attention of some Greek and Roman writers, and
influenced them to a certain extent in the composition of
several of their beautiful metaphors and similes? It is
almost universally admitted that later and more modern
versions of the Bible have exercised a perceptible influence
upon modern writers, such as Shakespeare, Milton, Dante,
Racine, Goethe, Schiller, and others, and in the same way
a connexion between the Bible and some of the ancient
classics might reasonably be established.
</p>

<p>
Coming now to the main subject under discussion, we
notice that metaphors are found everywhere in the Bible, but
that they especially abound in its poetical parts. The way
in which they are there employed varies greatly, and they
derive their inspiration from both animate and inanimate
life. Space, however, will not permit of more than a few
<span class="pageno target" title="16" id="page-16"></span>
illustrations, and these will, for convenience' sake, be specially
selected from Hebrew nouns that occur here and
there in the first few chapters of Genesis.
</p>

<p>
The third verse in the first chapter of Genesis, which, by
the way, is one of the most effective sentences in the whole
Bible, contains twice the term “light” (<i>or</i>,
<span class="heb" title="or" xml:lang="he">אור</span>). Now,
this word was frequently employed by some authors of the
Bible as a metaphor. Thus, for example, using the term
“light” in a spiritual sense, and making it signify favour
and grace, they applied it, in the first instance, to God, as
the Psalmist puts it, “For with thee (O Lord) is the fountain
of life: in thy <i>light</i> shall we see <i>light</i>” (Ps. xxxvi. 10).
The same term is frequently employed by the prophet
Isaiah as the emblem of enlightenment as well as that of
joy and exultation. In fact, some of Isaiah's most beautiful
metaphors are taken from this very word, one of which
runs thus:—“The people that walked in darkness have
seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the
shadow of death upon them has a light shined” (Isa. ix. 1).
In another place (ibid. xlii. 6) he says: “I the Lord have
called thee in righteousness .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and given thee for a
covenant of the people, for a <i>light</i> of the nations.” It is
interesting to note that some of the authors of the New
Testament have often employed the term “light” in a
number of striking metaphors, tacitly borrowed, it may
be observed, from the Old Testament. Martin Luther, too,
failed to acknowledge his obligation to his Hebrew tutor,
Nicolaus de Lyra, who helped him greatly in the preparation
of the famous German version of the Bible<a id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor"><sup>[16-1]</sup></a>.
</p>

<p>
Turning now to some parallels found in the Greek and
Latin classics, we meet one in the fifth ode of the fourth book
of Horace, in which the latter implores the absent Emperor
<span class="pageno target" title="17" id="page-17"></span>
Augustus to return speedily to the Roman capital, where
his noble presence was anxiously looked for by his loving
subjects. The stanza in question runs thus:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Lucem redde tuae, dux bone, patriae;</p>
    <p class="verse">Instar veris enim vultus ubi tuus</p>
    <p class="verse">Affulsit populo, gratior it dies,</p>
    <p class="verse2">Et soles melius nitent.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Restore, Great Sir, your country's light;</p>
    <p class="verse">For, as in spring the sun is softly bright,</p>
    <p class="verse">So, when on us thy countenance's beams arise,</p>
    <p class="verse">Fairer days appear, and smile o'er the skies<a id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor"><sup>[17-1]</sup></a>.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
Homer, too, often uses light and fire as metaphors, which
are in some instances quite of a Biblical type. Take, for
instance, the following lines that occur in the eleventh book
of the <i>Iliad</i>:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">As the red star shows his sanguine fires</p>
    <p class="verse">Through the dark clouds, and now in night retires:</p>
    <p class="verse">Thus through the ranks appear'd the godlike man,</p>
    <p class="verse">Plunged in the rear, or blazing in the van;</p>
    <p class="verse">While streamy sparkles, restless as he flies,</p>
    <p class="verse">Flash from his arms, as lightning from the skies.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
Again, in the nineteenth book of the <i>Odyssey</i> (35–41),
Homer has a metaphor from fire, from which it may be seen
that in his time a notion was prevalent among the Greeks
that a miraculous light was a sure token of the presence of
some divinity. The lines in question run as follows:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">What miracle thus dazzles with surprise;</p>
    <p class="verse">Distinct in rows the radiant columns rise!</p>
    <p class="verse">The walls, wherein my wondering sight I turn,</p>
    <p class="verse">And roofs amidst a blaze of glory burn.</p>
    <p class="verse">Some visitant of pure ethereal race</p>
    <p class="verse">With his bright presence, deigns the dome of grace<a id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor"><sup>[17-2]</sup></a>.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="18" id="page-18"></span>
</div>

<p>
Not less prolific in metaphors of the same description is
Virgil.
</p>

<p>
But particularly interesting is one of his metaphors that
occurs in the eighth book of the <i>Aeneid</i> (409–13), inasmuch
as it seems to be a poetical imitation of another found in
the last chapter of the Book of Proverbs, in which the
model housewife—the <i>Esheth Chayil</i>—is so beautifully
described, who rises early in the morning, wakes her
housemaids, and prolongs the day with the help of a lamp.
It runs thus:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Now, when the night her middle race has rode,</p>
    <p class="verse">And his first slumbers had refreshed the god,</p>
    <p class="verse">The time when early housewives leave the bed;</p>
    <p class="verse">When living embers on the hearth they spread,</p>
    <p class="verse">Supply the lamps, and call the maids to rise;</p>
    <p class="verse">With yawning mouth, and with half-opened eyes</p>
    <p class="verse">They ply the distaff by the winking light,</p>
    <p class="verse">And to their labour add the night<a id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor"><sup>[18-1]</sup></a>.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
We pass now to another fruitful subject, from which the
writers of the Bible have often taken metaphors, viz. the
sea, the torrent, and the waters, generally that mostly serve
to typify calamity. So Job (vi. 15) has a long and quite
Homeric metaphor, formed from a torrent, which begins
with the words: “My brothers have dealt deceitfully as
the torrent, nay, as a channel of torrents that pass away.”
</p>

<p>
Sometimes roaring waters are used in the Bible as
symbols of a battle cry, or of the tumult of an invading
army. Thus we find in the eighth chapter of Isaiah the
following description of the invasion of Palestine by the
king of Assyria: “Behold, the Lord bringeth up upon thee
the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of
Assyria: and he shall come up over all his channels, and
<span class="pageno target" title="19" id="page-19"></span>
go over all his banks .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he shall overflow and go over
and shall reach even to the neck.” A similar metaphor is
contained in the seventeenth book of the <i>Iliad</i> (263),
which runs thus:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Like a mountain billow that foams and raves,</p>
    <p class="verse">Where some swoll'n river disembogues his waves;</p>
    <p class="verse">Full in the mouth is stopp'd the rushing tide,</p>
    <p class="verse">The boiling ocean works from side to side,</p>
    <p class="verse">The river trembles to his utmost store,</p>
    <p class="verse">And distant rocks re-bellow to the roar:</p>
    <p class="verse">So fierce to the charge great Hector led the strong,</p>
    <p class="verse">Whole Troy embodied rush'd with shouts along.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
Metaphors of a similar kind are also now and again employed
by Virgil, and once he uses both fire and the torrent
at the same time as similes of uproar and destruction,
which usually take place on the battlefield. The simile in
question, which occurs in the <i>Aeneid</i> (xii. 760), reads
thus:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">As flames among the lofty woods are thrown</p>
    <p class="verse">On different sides, and both by winds are blown;</p>
    <p class="verse">The laurels crackle in the sputtering fire;</p>
    <p class="verse">The frighted sylvans from their shades retire:</p>
    <p class="verse">Or as two neighbouring torrents fall from high,</p>
    <p class="verse">Rapid they run; the foamy waters fry;</p>
    <p class="verse">They roll to sea with unresisted force,</p>
    <p class="verse">And down the rocks precipitate their course:</p>
    <p class="verse">Not with less rage the rival heroes take</p>
    <p class="verse">Their different ways; nor less destruction make.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
An equally wide field for Biblical metaphors is supplied
by the world of trees, flowers, and plants. Man is often
compared with them, but, strange to say, in two opposite
directions: sometimes, inasmuch as he is like them, liable
to decay and death; sometimes because unlike them, he
does not revive again after death. As instances, the
beautiful metaphor in the 103rd Psalm may be quoted:
“As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field,
so he flourisheth. For the wind passeth over it, and it is
gone: and the place thereof knoweth it no more.” To this
<span class="pageno target" title="20" id="page-20"></span>
may be added a similar, but shorter, metaphor, the author
of which was the often-quoted Ben-Sira. Of this only
a small part has been preserved in the Talmud (<i>Erubin</i>,
p. 54), which runs as follows: “<i>Rab</i> said to <i>Rab Hammuna</i>:
My son if thou hast (aught) enjoy it, for there is
no enjoyment in the nether world (<i>Shéol</i>), and death does
not tarry. And if thou sayest, I will leave (aught) to my
children, who will declare to thee the law in the nether
world? The sons of men are like the grass of the field;
some of them blossom, and some wither away.”
</p>

<p>
Homer has a striking parallel to it in the sixth book of
his <i>Iliad</i> (190), which runs thus:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Like leaves on trees the race of man is found,</p>
    <p class="verse">Now green in youth, now withering in the ground.</p>
    <p class="verse">Another race the following spring supplies,</p>
    <p class="verse">They fall successive, and successive rise:</p>
    <p class="verse">So generations in their course decay,</p>
    <p class="verse">So flourish these, when those are passed away.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
Speaking about metaphors from vegetation mention
should be made of an exceedingly pretty simile composed
in German by the late Ludwig August Frankl, of Vienna,
and probably borrowed from the beautiful lines occurring
towards the end of the fifty-fifth chapter of the Book of
Isaiah, viz. “As the rain cometh down, and the snow
from heaven, and returneth not hither, but watereth the
earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give
seed to the sower and bread to the eater,” &amp;c. In his
simile Frankl compares the heaven with a bridegroom who
weds the earth in springtime as his bride, and she late in
the summer season bears lovely fruit. The English version
runs somewhat as follows:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <p class="poetry-title">The Beautiful Month of May.</p>
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">This charming month is like a kiss,</p>
    <p class="verse">Given by heaven to his bride, the earth;</p>
    <p class="verse">Telling her with a hidden blush</p>
    <p class="verse">That a mother's joy will soon be hers.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
Another word occurring at the beginning of the first
<span class="pageno target" title="21" id="page-21"></span>
chapter of Genesis that is now and again used in the Bible
as a metaphor, is <i>Ruach</i> (<span class="heb" title="ruach" xml:lang="he">רוח</span>),
meaning sometimes “wind,”
and sometimes “spirit,” or divine inspiration. It is so commonly
used in the latter sense that no comment is necessary
here. What is, however, worth mentioning in connexion
with it is that Homer also used it in the same sense, whenever
he referred to the influence which his deities exercised
on the human mind. There are likewise several fine
Biblical metaphors modelled on <i>Ruach</i> (“the wind”), when it
is employed either in its ordinary sense or as the emblem
of punishment and calamity. So Jeremiah (iv. 11): “A
dry wind blows from the high places in the wilderness
toward the daughters of my people, not to fan, nor to
cleanse; a powerful wind it is that shall come from those
<i>places</i> unto me, and now I will hold judgment upon them.”
</p>

<p>
Isaiah's simile, “As the trees of the wood are moved
with the wind” (Isa. vii. 2), has found a pretty parallel in
Virgil's <i>Aeneid</i> (iv. 638), which runs thus:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">As when the winds their airy quarrel try,</p>
    <p class="verse">Justling from every quarter of the sky;</p>
    <p class="verse">This way and that the mountain oak they bend;</p>
    <p class="verse">His boughs they shatter, and his branches rend;</p>
    <p class="verse">With leaves and fallings most they spread the ground;</p>
    <p class="verse">The hollow valleys echo to the sound;</p>
    <p class="verse">Unmoved, the royal plant their fury mocks,</p>
    <p class="verse">Or shaken, clings more closely to the rocks.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
The following is another metaphor of a somewhat similar
kind, employed by Homer in the <i>Iliad</i> (xvii. 57), which
bears a great resemblance to the lovely one found in the
103rd Psalm, to which reference has been made above. It
runs as follows:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">As the young olive in some sylvan scene,</p>
    <p class="verse">Crowned by fresh fountains with eternal green,</p>
    <p class="verse">Lifts the gay head, in snowy flowerets fair,</p>
    <p class="verse">And plays and dances to the gentle air;</p>
    <p class="verse">When lo! a whirlwind from high heaven invades</p>
    <p class="verse">The tender plant, and withers all its shades;</p>
    <p class="verse">It lies uprooted from its genial bed:</p>
    <p class="verse">A lovely ruin, now defaced and dead.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="22" id="page-22"></span>
</div>

<p>
Passing now from inanimate nature to animate things,
there are in the Bible a good many metaphors based
thereon. Here, again, it is the prophet Isaiah who furnishes
us with the largest number of instances. One of
them is the bee that symbolizes an invading army, working
all kinds of mischief. Thus we read in Isaiah (vii. 18):—“On
that day will the Lord hiss for the fly that is in the
uttermost part of the river of Egypt, and for the bee that
is in the land of Assyria, and they shall all come and rest
in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and
upon all thorn-bushes, and upon all the pastures.” A fine
parallel occurs in Homer's <i>Iliad</i> (ii. 87), which runs as
follows:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">As from some rocky cleft the shepherd sees</p>
    <p class="verse">Clustering in heaps on heaps the driving bees,</p>
    <p class="verse">Rolling and blackening, swarms succeeding swarms</p>
    <p class="verse">With deeper murmur and more hoarse alarms;</p>
    <p class="verse">Dusky they spread, a close embodied crowd,</p>
    <p class="verse">And o'er the vale descends the living cloud:</p>
    <p class="verse">So from the tents and ships, a lengthened train</p>
    <p class="verse">Spreads all the beach, and wide o'ershades the plain:</p>
    <p class="verse">Along the region runs a deafening sound;</p>
    <p class="verse">Beneath their footsteps groans the trembling ground.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
Towards the end of the Book of Ecclesiastes (xii. 5) a
comparison is made between an old man who gradually
loses his white locks and an almond-tree that sheds its
white blossoms. Anacreon has in one of his Odes (the
eleventh) a few exceedingly pretty lines, which recall the
foregoing figure. They run as follows:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Oft I am by women told,</p>
    <p class="verse">Poor Anacreon! thou grow'st old;</p>
    <p class="verse">Look how thy hairs are falling all:</p>
    <p class="verse">Poor Anacreon! how they fall!</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
The Biblical story found in the fourth Book of Moses
(xiv. 2–11) seems to have been known and partly reproduced
by Virgil in the first book of the <i>Aeneid</i>, 148.
<span class="pageno target" title="23" id="page-23"></span>
There the following lines occur, which offer a most
striking parallel:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">As when in tumults rise the ignoble crowd,</p>
    <p class="verse">Mad are their motions, and their tongues are loud;</p>
    <p class="verse">And stones and brands in rattling volleys fly,</p>
    <p class="verse">And all the rustic arms that fury can supply:</p>
    <p class="verse">If then some grave and pious men appear,</p>
    <p class="verse">They hush their noise, and lend a listening ear:</p>
    <p class="verse">He soothes with sober words their angry mood,</p>
    <p class="verse">And quenches their innate desire for blood<a id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor"><sup>[23-1]</sup></a>.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
The few observations offered here will no doubt give
some idea of the importance attaching to a closer investigation
of the whole subject<a id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor"><sup>[23-2]</sup></a>. Many volumes are annually
devoted to the study of the Old Testament, but these are
almost exclusively written from a religious point of view.
Surely, it could not but gain in popular estimation if its
great literary worth attracted more general attention.

<a href="#toc-return-III">ART AMONG THE ANCIENT HEBREWS</a></span></h2>

<p>
<span class="begc">The</span> ancient Hebrews were an art-loving people, and
occupied a fair position among those Eastern nations of
antiquity, who attained some success in the production
of works of artistic merit. Their success in Music and
Poetry was undoubted, and becomes even more striking
when it is remembered that it had been won by the Jewish
nation at a time when in Greece, for instance, the cultivation
of these arts was still in its infancy. The period of
their artistic activity extended from the days of Moses to
the time of the destruction of the last Temple in Jerusalem
by Titus (70 <span class="bc">A. D.</span>).
It is proposed in the present essay to
deal, first with the <i>Architecture</i>, then with the <i>Music</i>, and
finally with the <i>Poetry</i> of the ancient Hebrews.
</p>

<p>
Just as among other nations of antiquity architecture had
its origin in religion, and owed its development to religion,
so it was among the Jews. The first feeble attempt at architecture,
though it is perhaps incorrect to call it by that name,
was the erection of the Tabernacle in the wilderness. This
was certainly nothing more than a large-sized movable
tent, and had no special beauty about it, but the fact that
the original design was retained and used on a larger scale
at the construction of the subsequent Temples of Jerusalem,
invests it with more than ordinary importance. From this
it may also be seen that the Jewish architect, even in those
early times, had in the drawing up of its ground-plan
some glimmering of symmetry and purity of form. Noticeable
also is the great skill manifested at that time by the
Jewish artisans in the manufacture of the furniture of
the Tabernacle, the beautiful covers and curtains with
<span class="pageno target" title="25" id="page-25"></span>
their inwoven cherubims, the seven-branched golden candlestick
of beaten work, and the circular-shaped laver made
by them from the metallic mirrors presented by the women
of the community (Exod. xxxviii. 8). The erection of the
Tabernacle was followed by some centuries of architectural
and artistic barrenness. This epoch includes the time of
their sojourn in the Arabian desert, and the period during
which they were governed by the Judges, and subsequently
by King Saul. Those years were marked by internal and
external struggles, and consequently did not admit of the
free development of any of those arts which, generally
speaking, flourish only in times of undisturbed peace, and
under the protection of a strong government. In the
reigns of David and Solomon, however, when the Jews
began to enjoy the first-fruits of peace and national
prosperity, the general spread of culture and architectural
skill at once became manifest. The sacred and royal
buildings erected by the various Jewish kings, and particularly
the Temple of Solomon, show the pitch of artistic
excellence which they had attained.
</p>

<p>
There is no doubt much exaggeration in the statement
made by some writers that classical antiquity was largely
indebted to the Temple for many details of art, and that
throughout the Middle Ages the form and shape of all
Christian churches were modelled after its design. Considering,
however, the attention and interest which the
Temple has excited, there can be little doubt of its
extraordinary artistic value. Its original form and mode
of structure have already been so often and so minutely
described by learned men of all ages and countries that
there is hardly anything new left to be said about it. A
few observations, however, concerning the builders, and
the difficulties encountered by them at its erection, may not
be out of place here. Some writers are of opinion that the
fame and magnificence of the Temple were entirely due to
the skill of Phoenician artisans, and not to the proficiency
of Jewish workmen. The soundness of this theory is,
<span class="pageno target" title="26" id="page-26"></span>
however, very questionable. In the first place, we have
it on the authority of the Biblical memorials that the
assistance given by the Phoenicians to the Jewish workmen
at the erection of the Temple consisted mainly in felling
cedar-trees on Mount Lebanon, and in manufacturing the
artistic metal-work of the building. Next, the fact already
mentioned that the original Mosaic model of the Tabernacle
had been retained, and used on a larger scale in the construction
of the Temple, proves at once its purely Jewish
character. We must also come to the same conclusion
when we consider that its internal and external decoration
consisted mostly of flowers and plants that only grew on
Palestinian soil.
</p>

<p>
As for the structure itself, it may be mentioned that
many difficulties had to be overcome before the actual
building operations began. The summit of Mount Moriah,
on which King David had decided to erect the Temple,
was too narrow to permit of large buildings being established
thereon. Thus gigantic supports and walls had
to be erected, which, owing no doubt to their great
strength and durability, have been preserved to the present
day. They bear a great similarity to the Cyclopean walls
built by the oldest races of Greece in Asia Minor, and the
immensity of each block of stone is such that it has excited
the wonder of various modern travellers (cp. Layard,
<i>Nineveh and Babylon</i>, p. 62). These enormous stones were,
strange to say, put together without the aid of tools. The
latter, made as they were out of a material from which
weapons of war are manufactured, were used as little as
possible at the erection of a building which was intended,
in conformity with the true spirit of Judaism, to serve as
a symbol of Peace. There is another noticeable feature
in connexion with the building, namely, that all its bronze
works were cast in earthen moulds in the valley of the
Jordan. This spot was specially selected for the purpose,
on account of its fine clay soil. Thus it will be seen that
even at this early period in the history of architecture the
<span class="pageno target" title="27" id="page-27"></span>
Jews must have had some knowledge of mining. Later on,
at the time when the Romans were the masters of the land,
the mines of Phaino enjoyed a very great reputation (cp.
Ewald, <i>History of Israel</i>, ed. Carpenter, vol. IV, p. 192).
A modern writer of note (James Fergusson), in referring to
the Temple of Solomon, expresses himself thus:—“Whatever
the exact appearance of its details may have been, it
may safely be asserted that the triple Temple of Jerusalem—the
lower court, standing on its magnificent terrace—the
inner court, raised on its platform in the centre of this—and
the Temple itself, rising out of the group and crowning
the whole—must have formed, when combined with the
beauty of its situation, one of the most splendid architectural
combinations of the old world” (cp. Smith's <i>Bible
Dictionary</i>, <i>sub</i> Temple).
</p>

<p>
In connexion with the Temple two other branches of
architecture may be mentioned here—the water conduits
and bridges, or rather viaducts, built by King Solomon.
The former must have been of some importance; they are
quoted by Tacitus, who speaks of <i>Fons perennis aquae,
cavati sub terra montes</i> (cp. <i>Hist.</i> vol. 12). As for the
bridges or viaducts, it is said that they were four in
number, and of a peculiar construction. One led over the
valley of Gihon; another, called by Josephus <i>gerupha</i>,
connected Mount Zion with Mount Moriah, and served as
a viaduct for the king on his visiting the Temple (cp. <i>Ant.</i>
xv. 11. 5). The third and fourth are referred to in Talmud
<i>Jer. Shekalim</i>, 4. 4, and in <i>Yomah</i>, 4 <i>b</i>.
</p>

<p>
In subsequent times two more Temples were built after
the design of Solomon's—one by Zerubbabel with the permission
and assistance of the Persian king Cyrus (558 <span class="bc">B. C.</span>),
and another by King Herod (16 <span class="bc">B. C.</span>), who, next to Solomon,
was the most art-loving monarch the Jews ever had.
During his reign the influence of Greek taste began to
make itself felt in Palestine, and we are told that, in
addition to the temple, he also built colonnades, theatres,
and castles (cp. Jos. <i>Ant.</i> xv. 8. 1). According to the same
<span class="pageno target" title="28" id="page-28"></span>
authority (<i>Bell. Jud.</i> 5. 44), the beauty of King Herod's
residential palace was beyond all description. It consisted
of a block of various marble buildings, with artistically
formed roofs, each building having magnificent halls and
colonnades. Pleasure grounds, tiny forests, and gardens of
every kind surrounded it, and elaborate waterworks were
built to give these grounds a never-failing freshness of
appearance. The Greek style did not, however, altogether
supersede the Phoenician, for even as late as the <i>Mishna</i>,
mention is made of Tyrian windows and porches (cp.
Talmud, <i>Baba Bathra</i>, p. 36).
</p>

<p>
It would not be easy to describe here all the other architectural
works of Solomon and the rest of the Jewish kings.
The former's palace ought not, however, to be passed over
unnoticed, especially as in splendour and architectural beauty
it rivalled the Temple itself. It consisted of a row of large
buildings, among which the king's private residence, that of
the Egyptian princes, and the so-called house of the forest
of Lebanon, were the most prominent. With the aid of
his great waterworks in the neighbourhood of the city,
Solomon laid out all kinds of gardens and pleasure-grounds,
the beauty of which was enhanced by the addition of
fountains and artificial lakes (cp. Cant. iv. 13–15). At
Etam he had a magnificent park and gymnasium, which
he occasionally visited. Not far from Lebanon he erected
some lofty towers ornamented largely with gold and ivory
(Cant. viii. 11; <i>Ant.</i> iii. 7. 3).
</p>

<p>
That the Greeks used ivory for the ornamentation of
houses and public buildings, may be seen from the passage
in Eurip. <i>Iph. Aul.</i>, where
<span xml:lang="grc" title="elephantinoi domoi">ἐλεφάντινοι δόμοι</span>
(houses made of ivory) are mentioned.
</p>

<p>
Referring to the great taste for landscape culture displayed
by the Hebrews of old, Humboldt says that nowhere
in antiquity, and not even among the Greeks, is so
much sense for the beauties of nature met with as in the
Bible. With regard to sculpture it ought to be mentioned
that the ancient Hebrews did not to any great extent
<span class="pageno target" title="29" id="page-29"></span>
cultivate this art. This was in consequence of the law which
forbade them to introduce any kind of graven image in
their places of worship. A few monuments, however, are
mentioned as having been erected by them, such as the one
built by Absalom, which, according to Josephus (<i>Ant.</i> vii.
10. 3), was a marble column. Another, erected in memory
of Queen Helena, consisted of three small pyramids, and
was considered a beautiful work of art (ibid. xx. 4. 3).
</p>

<p>
The tools that were used in those times by Hebrew
artisans were, in addition to the more common ones, such
as the axe, saw, and others, the compass (<i>Mechugah</i>) (Isa.
xliv. 13), the plumb-line (<i>Anach</i>) (Amos vii. 7), and the
measuring-reed (<i>Kav</i>) (cp. Job xxxviii. 5).
</p>

<p>
As for the artisans' position it may be said that they
were not merely servants and slaves as among the Greeks
and Romans, but men holding some rank in society. For
instance, of Bezaleel and Aholiab, the principal architects
of the Tabernacle, it is said that “they were filled with the
spirit of the Lord” (Exod. xxxvi. 1), and had they not been
classed among the wisest men of their time, and held in
high esteem by the community at large, no respect would
have been paid to them by the Biblical memorials. The
number of Jewish artisans of every description appears to
have been considerable, and this was specially the case
during the time when the national prosperity was advancing
(Jer. xxix. 2). Even during the Captivity, and later
on when the Jews were finally scattered over the world,
their Rabbis urgently recommended them to teach their
children some art or handicraft.
</p>

<p>
The same exaggeration in respect of the achievements of
the ancient Hebrews in the art of architecture is also found
in reference to the perfection which they attained in science
and the art of music. However that may be, it can hardly
be denied that they were, on the whole, an eminently
musical people. This can be seen from the comparatively
large number of Hebrew words denoting song and chanting,
as well as from Hebrew poetry, a considerable portion of
<span class="pageno target" title="30" id="page-30"></span>
which has been conceived in the form of psalmody or sacred
lyric song. As among the Greeks, Jewish tradition ascribes
the invention of the first musical instrument to shepherds.
Jubal is designated in the Bible as the father of all such as
handle the harp or organ (Gen. iv. 21). Other passages in
the same book relating to musical instruments and to their
use, are found in connexion with Laban, Miriam, and Jephthah.
But a real and systematic cultivation of the art of
music did not begin before the days of Samuel and Saul;
the former of whom seems to have been the founder of a
regular school of music (1 Sam. x. 5). There a great number
of students received their training, and the most able among
them were subsequently selected for the choir of the Temple.
Already in the time of David 4,000 singers, mostly Levites,
assisted in the service of the Lord, being presided over by
the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun. In subsequent
ages their services are recorded in connexion with the laying
of the foundation of the second Temple (Ezra iii. 10),
and again, after the great victory of the Maccabean army
over Gorgias (1 Macc. iv. 24).
</p>

<p>
The instruments used by the ancient Hebrews were of
three different kinds—percussion instruments, such as tambourines,
drums, and cymbals; wind instruments, such as
trumpets, horns, and flutes; and stringed instruments, such
as harps, psalteries, and guitars. Another peculiar instrument
is mentioned in the Talmud (<i>Erachin</i>, ii <i>a</i>) as having
been used in the Temple service, which was called <i>Magrepha</i>
(<span class="heb" title="magrepha" xml:lang="he">מגרפה</span>).
This is said to have had about a hundred
different tones, and was audible at a very long distance.
These instruments seem to have been used in the Temple
service after a pause in the singing. Such a pause was
perhaps notified by the word <i>Selah</i>
(<span class="heb" title="selah" xml:lang="he">סלה</span>), which is so
often met with in the Psalms, and is translated in the
Septuagint by <i>diapsalma</i>
(<span xml:lang="grc" title="diapsalma">διαψάλμα</span>) (cf. Bötticher, <i>De
inferis rebusque post mortem futuris Hebraeorum et Graecorum
opiniones</i>, Dresden, 1868, p. 198). That the
Temple music must have exercised a vast influence on the
<span class="pageno target" title="31" id="page-31"></span>
cultivation and development of the Church songs and
music can hardly be doubted. Martini, who was a great
authority on such matters, maintains that the first Christian
choral songs were taken from the songs of the Temple. It
is quite natural, he says, that the Apostles should have
introduced into the Church services only those melodies
that had been familiar to them from their earliest infancy
(cp. <i>Storia della Musica</i>, p. 350).
</p>

<p>
But it was not in the service of religion alone that music
was performed among the ancient Hebrews: it permeated
their whole public and private life. Following the example
of David and Solomon, who had attached to their
courts “singing men and singing women” (2 Sam. xix. 36;
Eccles. ii. 8), the rich men in Israel often, employed music
and song at their banquets (Amos vi. 4–6). When bridal
processions passed through the streets, they were accompanied
with music and song (Jer. vii. 34). The same was
the case when victories were celebrated, or when the Jewish
armies went to battle (Exod. xv. 20; xx. 19). There
seems also to have existed a kind of Jewish troubadours,
who sang love-songs before the windows of their chosen
ones (Ps. xlv, title). The harvest was gathered in to the
tunes of merry songs (Isa. xvi. 10), and at funeral processions
mournful music was played (Jer. ix. 17–20).
</p>

<p>
That a high position must have been assigned by the
ancient Hebrews to those who were skilled in song and
music, may be seen from the term applied to them in the
Hebrew writings. There they are frequently called
<i>Nebiim</i> (<span class="heb" title="nevi'im" xml:lang="he">נביאים</span>),
“Prophets,” and of Jahaziel, a Levite of
the sons of Asaph, it is said that “the spirit of the Lord
came over him” (2 Chron. xx. 14). Thus the art of music
was looked upon by the Hebrews as being the outcome of
divine inspiration, and its disciples were consequently held
in great esteem by them. But music and song only
flourished among them so long as they were masters in
their own country, and were free men in a free land.
When their nationality had ceased to exist, and they were
<span class="pageno target" title="32" id="page-32"></span>
led into captivity, they hung their harps on the willows
by the streams of Babylon, and uttered those memorable
and touching words: “How shall we sing the song of the
Lord in a foreign land?” (Ps. cxxxvii. 4).
</p>

<p>
The third branch of the arts to which I now pass is
Hebrew Poetry. Martin Luther, in his <i>Table Talk</i>, compares
it with the sweet melody of a nightingale, and it is
frequently admitted that, the Greeks and Romans perhaps
excepted, no nation of antiquity has produced anything in
the shape of poetry that can be compared with that of the
Hebrews. There are three kinds of poetry in the Hebrew
literature—<i>dramatic</i>, <i>gnomic</i>, and <i>lyrical</i>. The latter
occupies the most prominent position. The drama is
represented by two pieces, the Book of Job and the Song
of Songs. The Book of Job is considered by many as the
masterpiece of Hebrew poetry. Its fine introduction with
its double scene in heaven and on earth, in which Satan
plays so prominent a rôle, was imitated by Goethe in his
“Faust.” Equally grand, though in a different style, is the
Song of Songs. Herder, in referring to it, says that it is
the most beautiful piece of poetry that has ever been produced
by any poet of ancient or modern times. He is of
opinion that in no other poem has love been so charmingly
depicted as there, and even now, in spite of its great age,
it has lost none of its freshness of colouring and beauty
of diction. It is a true monument of genuine pastoral and
idyllic poetry.
</p>

<p>
The gnomic poetry comprises that section of Hebrew
literature which contains pithy maxims or proverbs. To
this class of poetry belong the Book of Proverbs, the Book
of Ecclesiastes, and the Proverbs of Jesus ben Sirach, better
known under the name of Ecclesiasticus. Though the
religious element is not entirely excluded from these books,
yet they chiefly treat of worldly subjects. Some passages
therein contain humorous descriptions of various human
characters. The bookworm, the scribbler, the miser, the
dull preacher, the quarrelsome woman, the drunkard—they
<span class="pageno target" title="33" id="page-33"></span>
are all referred to, and spoken of with good-natured
humour and irony<a id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor"><sup>[33-1]</sup></a>.
</p>

<p>
The lyric poetry of the Jews is almost entirely of a religious
nature. To this class belong the Psalms, which are
confessedly the peculiar product of Hebrew Art. They
have never been surpassed in any other literature in
simplicity of diction and originality of sentiment. Being
the classical expression of the speech of the religious mind,
they have naturally become a treasure-house for the
language and thought of the Christian world. The Christian
liturgy and the songs of the Church abound with beautiful
sentences borrowed from them.
</p>

<p>
The Book of Psalms contains 150 songs, most of which
are said to have been composed by King David. Psalms
occur also here and there in other parts of the Bible, such as
those of Samuel's mother (1 Sam. ii), of Isaiah (chap. xii),
of Hezekiah (ibid. xxxviii. 9), and of Habakkuk. There are
also Hebrew songs which are similar to the Psalms in
respect of form, but not of subject. To this class of Psalms
belong, for instance, Jacob's last blessing, Balaam's prophecies,
the Song of Deborah, and the Lamentations of
Jeremiah. In the Psalms songs are also met with which
are of a joyful nature, such as wedding songs, love songs,
and wine songs.
</p>

<p>
Hebrew poetry has many characteristics of its own, the
most prominent of which are national and local colouring,
and, secondly, its profound humility and reverence. Its
writers never lose sight of the grand idea of their nation,
which subordinates all and everything in the universe to
one supreme power called God, the Creator of heaven and
earth. Even man, the crown of the creation, is, according
to them, only an <i>Adam</i> or <i>Enosh</i>
(<span class="heb" title="adam" xml:lang="he">אדם</span>,
<span class="heb" title="enosh" xml:lang="he">אנוש</span>), an insignificant,
helpless being, in comparison to <i>Eloha</i>
(<span class="heb" title="Eloha" xml:lang="he">אלוה</span>, Arab.
<i>Allah</i>), the most powerful Lord of the universe. Thus
man is compared by them to a flower that withers, to a
shadow that passes by, and to a cloud that vanishes in the
<span class="pageno target" title="34" id="page-34"></span>
air; while at the same time they call the thunder “the voice
of the Lord,” the wind “his messenger,” the clouds “the
cover of his brightness,” the lightning “his servant,” and
the sun “the herald of his majesty.” But though they
let Nature be subservient to and dependent on God, yet
they preserve a loving attachment to it, and endow it, as it
were, with life and animation. They let it share man's
sentiments; it rejoices and trembles with man, and it
laughs and weeps with him.
</p>

<p>
Every extraordinary event in the life of the nation affects
Nature as it does the human mind. So, for instance, when
the Hebrew exiles are described by the prophet as returning
to the land of their nativity, the desert rejoices and
changes into a beautiful garden filled with rose blossoms,
and fragrant with the perfume of sweet plants. The mountains
and the hills break forth into song, and the trees
of the fields clap their hands. In those happy days, neither
the light of the sun nor the brightness of the moon will be
required by the liberated exiles, for the Lord will be unto
them an everlasting light (Isa. xxxv. 1; lv. 12; lx. 20).
On the other hand, when God sits in judgment, and a great
catastrophe is imminent over the inhabitants of the land,
then the earth shakes and trembles, and the foundations of
the hills move. The heaven becomes clouded, and the
brightness of the sun disappears; the moon and the stars
shine no more (Ps. xviii. 8; Ez. xxxii. 7).
</p>

<p>
The <i>form</i> of Hebrew poetry has been widely discussed.
<a id="p34l28"></a>Some writers, such as Philo, Josephus, Eusebius, St. Jerome,
and others, maintain that in some Biblical poems the
Iambic, Alcaic, and Sapphic metres were used, and that in
others the heroic metre was employed. Others, again, are
rather inclined to think that the Hebrews wrote in no
regular metrical periods, but only preserved a kind of
parallelism of sentences. No one will deny that the Greeks
and the Romans have produced literary works, which in
elegance of expression and symmetry of form are much
superior to those of the Hebrews. But at the same time
<span class="pageno target" title="35" id="page-35"></span>
it will be conceded by those who have a taste for genuine
poetry, that in the freshness of colouring, depth of thought,
and vivacity of representation, the poetical pieces of the
Bible stand very high. Though written thousands of
years ago, they still preserve their sway over the human
heart, and afford consolation and hope to the afflicted and
oppressed.
</p>

<p>
From what has been said it will be seen how unfounded
the charge is, so often made in certain quarters against
the Jews, that they have never rendered any particular
service to the nations with whom they have come in
contact. Surely, if they had done nothing else but given
them the sacred volume, the Book of Books, which contains
so many golden rules for the cultivation of the human
mind and heart, they would, for that reason alone, be
entitled to expect acknowledgment and gratitude, not
only from the present but also from all future generations.

<a href="#toc-return-IV">THE LIFE OF THE HEBREW WOMEN OF OLD</a></span></h2>

<p>
<span class="begc">An</span> erroneous notion has long prevailed regarding the
place assigned to the Hebrew woman at home and in
society by the Mosaic law. Even now the idea obtains
that the law placed the Hebrew woman almost on the
same footing as the low-born slave, and denied her all
mental and spiritual enjoyments; that, because polygamy
was silently tolerated by the law, and because it gave
fathers and husbands a certain amount of authority over
their wives and daughters, the position of the Hebrew
woman must therefore have been exceedingly low. But
the student who closely examines the Old Testament
passages relating to her domestic and social life, will soon
see that this assumption is without foundation. A consideration
of her life during Biblical times will, in fact,
show that she enjoyed more freedom than other Oriental
women of that or even of the present time, and that in some
respects her position was not much inferior to that of her
modern descendants.
</p>

<p>
The Old Testament gives two distinct periods in the
history of the Hebrew woman. The first extends from the
times when the Israelites became established in Palestine,
and the second from that date to the building of the
second Temple. The most prominent feature of the first
period is an extreme simplicity of manners in both sexes,
occasioned by their living in the open air or in tents. It
resembles in many respects the heroic age of the ancient
Greeks, and especially with regard to the social position
of the female sex. But while in the Hebrew world the
woman is known as “Ish-shah”
(<span class="heb" title="ishah" xml:lang="he">אשה</span>), “wife,” being equal
<span class="pageno target" title="37" id="page-37"></span>
in moral as well as in literal etymology to “Ish”
(<span class="heb" title="ish" xml:lang="he">איש</span>),
“man,” the Greeks had separate words for <i>man</i> and <i>wife</i>,
namely, <span xml:lang="grc" title="anêr">ἀνήρ</span>,
<span xml:lang="grc" title="gynê">γυνή</span>, suggesting, perhaps,
the inferior rank
of the weaker sex among them. Again, while the Greeks
called their <i>first</i> woman <i>Pandora</i> as the bringer of all
evil to man, the first woman of the Bible, <i>Eve</i>, is introduced
to us as a part of her husband's being, and as
having been created to be “a helpmeet for him”
(<span class="heb" title="ezer kenegdo" xml:lang="he">עזר כנגדו</span>)
(Gen. ii. 18). Except Eve, who seems to have lived with
her family in the open air, the women belonging to that
period dwelt in tents. Such a tent was called in Hebrew
<i>ohel</i> (<span class="heb" title="ohel" xml:lang="he">אהל</span>),
and sometimes <i>baït</i>
(<span class="heb" title="bait" xml:lang="he">בית</span>)<a
  id="FNanchor_20" dir="ltr"></a><a href="#Footnote_20"
  class="fnanchor"><sup>[37-1]</sup></a>, and consisted of
a walled-in enclosure covered with curtains of a dark
colour (Cant. i. 5). It was divided into two or more
apartments, one being always reserved for the females of
the family; but sometimes each female had a separate
tent (Gen. xxxi. 33; cp. also Homer, <i>Iliad</i>, vi. 247–9).
When travelling the women's tents were fastened on a
broad cushion (<span class="heb" title="char" xml:lang="he">כר</span>),
and placed on the backs of the riding
camels (Gen. xxxi. 34). The occupations of the married
woman were multifarious. She rose early in the morning,
and spent the day in attending to her children, distributing
food at meal times, and weaving various textures for the
use of her family (Prov. xxxi. 15). Cp. Homer, <i>Odyss.</i> x.
221; and Virgil, <i>Georg.</i> i. 293–5:—

<p>
The cooking was also done by the mistress of the house,
and even women of rank did not consider it beneath their
dignity to help in culinary work (Gen. xviii. 5). Sometimes
a nurse was kept for the younger children of the
family, and was held in great estimation by her employers
(ibid. xxxv. 8). The surplus of their manufactures was
usually sold to merchants (Prov. xxxi. 24), but was sometimes
given away for religious purposes (Exod. xxxv. 22).
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="38" id="page-38"></span>

<p>
The unmarried women had, besides their share of the
domestic duties, the daily task of tending the flocks and
of taking them to the well, where the neighbouring shepherds
met them and indulged in gossip and hilarity
(Gen. xxix). On these occasions they moved about freely,
and could even dispense with the veil usually worn out
of doors by Oriental women (ibid. xii. 14). These diversions
ended when they entered upon the matrimonial
state, which they did between the ages of twelve and
eighteen years (Buxtorf, <i>Synag.</i> VII, 143). Sometimes
courtship preceded marriage, as in the cases of Jacob and
Samson; but the mediation of a third party was usual in
marriage negotiations (Gen. xxiv. 4). When the parents
approved of the bridegroom's proposals, the bride was
sometimes asked for her consent; but when she was of
a higher rank than the bridegroom, the father offered her
hand to him as a mark of special favour. Thus Jethro
did to Moses, Caleb to Othniel, and Saul to David. The
wedding itself had no definite ceremonies connected with it.
At the wedding of Rebekah and of Ruth only a blessing
was pronounced by those present. At a much later period
an oath was added in ratification of the union (Ezek.
xvi. 8). Indeed, marriage was always considered among
the Hebrews as an institution proceeding from God (Gen.
xxiv. 50; Judges xiv. 4); and the name given to it in
post-Biblical times and retained to the present day is
<i>Kiddushin</i> (<span class="heb" title="kiddushin" xml:lang="he">קדושין</span>),
i.e. “sanctification.” The Greeks and
Romans, on the other hand, called it
<span xml:lang="grc" title="syzygia">συζυγία</span> and <i>coniugium</i>
respectively, meaning “yoking together of two
persons,” and emphasizing essentially the civil nature of
the union.
</p>

<p>
Though polygamy was not actually forbidden by the
Mosaic law, yet it appears from the phraseology employed
at its first institution that monogamy was the only legitimate
practice. In Gen. ii. 24 it is said, “Therefore shall a man
leave his father and his mother and cleave unto his wife,”
and not his “wives.” Elkanah's <i>second</i> wife is, quaintly
<span class="pageno target" title="39" id="page-39"></span>
enough, called in 1 Sam. i <i>Tsara</i>, which term in Hebrew
also means “misery.”
</p>

<p>
The simplicity manifested in the manners of the Hebrew
women found its counterpart in their attire. This was
generally of a primitive order. On festive occasions, however,
apparel of a more elaborate character was used (Gen. xxiv. 53).
Personal ornaments were also sometimes worn; these were
mostly articles of gold, and, perhaps, even jewels, since
precious stones are mentioned in the Pentateuch. While
in Egypt, the Hebrew women learnt the use of mirrors,
which were then made of a mixture of copper and tin.
These mirrors they gave freely for the fabrication of the laver
of the Tabernacle (Exod. xxxviii. 8). At that time they
appear also to have acquired some proficiency in singing,
dancing, and playing on musical instruments; for on the
shore of the Red Sea we find them singing an ode together
with Miriam. Later on, they shared with the men the
privilege of being summoned to hear the reading of the law
(Deut. xxxi. 12). An old Sanscrit proverb says: “Women
are instructed by nature, but men obtain learning by books”;
nor are illustrations wanting in the Bible to prove the truth
of this saying. The Hebrew women had already cultivated
a taste for flowers (Gen. xxx. 14), song, and music; they
were active in their households, charitable to the poor and
needy (Prov. xxxi. 20); and, above all, they were sensible
of the blessing of freedom and independence.
</p>

<p>
During the second period of Biblical history, from the
settlement of the Israelites in Palestine to the rebuilding of
the second Temple, a remarkable change occurred in the
life, habits, and social standing of the Hebrew woman.
The simplicity of manners which had characterized the first
period gave place in course of time to luxurious living—the
result of residing in large towns and in permanent
dwelling-houses, and of closer social intercourse with men
of their own and foreign nations. The females of the poorer
and middle classes occupied the same room or rooms with
their husbands; but the wives of the rich and nobles had
<span class="pageno target" title="40" id="page-40"></span>
a separate set of apartments for themselves, called <i>harmon</i>
(<span class="heb" title="harmon" xml:lang="he">הרמון</span>)
(Amos iv. 3), most probably derived from <i>harem</i>
(<span class="heb" title="cherem" xml:lang="he">חרם</span>)
(forbidden), and akin to the modern <i>Harem</i>.
</p>

<p>
Yet the seclusion of women among the wealthy Hebrews
was at that period much less strict than with the modern
Mohammedans, or the ancient Persians and Greeks. As
among the Greeks (Homer, <i>Odyss.</i> i. 329–331), the Jewish
females occupied the upper part of the house, as instanced in
2 Sam. vi. 16, and 2 Kings ix. 31–33, in connexion with Michal
and Jezebel. But, while the former were not allowed to see
any one but their nearest relations (cp. Wieland, <i>Attisches
Museum</i>, II, 131), the latter moved about freely, and sometimes
took an active part in public life. As instances of
this may be mentioned Jephthah's daughter, Deborah,
Jezebel, Athalia, Huldah, Esther, and Noadiah. Deborah
and Hannah, as composers of excellent odes, have the
honour of being the first poetesses in history. Women
were also hired to chant doleful songs at the funerals of
persons of high rank (Jer. ix. 16). Sometimes they were
even employed to plead causes at the royal courts (2 Sam.
xiv. 2; 1 Kings i. 11). Then, again, there are instances of
women who, by their bravery and oratorical powers, saved
a whole town from destruction (Judges ix. 53; 2 Sam. xx.
18–23).
</p>

<p>
Their recreation consisted chiefly in paying visits to their
relations and friends, on which occasions refreshments were
served (Cant. viii. 2), and in attending at public festivals.
These were of frequent occurrence: religious celebrations,
or weddings, when the women assembled in the streets to
watch the gay procession of the guests (Jer. xxv. 10);
vintage festivals and harvest festivals where, amidst merriment
and laughter, men and women danced to the strains
of sweet music (Judges xxi. 21; Isa. xvi. 10; Jer. xxxi.
3,4). Recreation-houses<a id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor"><sup>[40-1]</sup></a> also existed, and were frequented
by women of rank (Micah ii. 9), but their exact nature is
not clearly defined. The prophet Isaiah devotes a whole
<span class="pageno target" title="41" id="page-41"></span>
chapter to the description of the dresses and trinkets worn
by the Hebrew women of his time; and even as far back
as the days of King Saul, women wore rich dresses of scarlet
and gold. David, when bewailing Saul's death, says: “Ye
daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in
scarlet with other delights, who put ornaments of gold upon
your dresses” (2 Sam. i. 24). This extravagance in women's
attire continued to the time of Christ; and according to
Edersheim (<i>Life and Times of Jesus</i>), a lady could then
get in Jerusalem “from a false tooth to an Arabian veil,
a Persian shawl, or an Indian dress.” The Jewish women,
like the Egyptian, the Greek, and the Roman, used precious
ointments and perfumes for their heads and dresses (Cant.
i. 3). The cost of a moderately-sized bottle of those
perfumes is stated to have been equal to £6 of our
money. Women of rank also used cosmetics for the eyelashes
(2 Kings ix. 30; Jer. iv. 30). Isaiah, deriding this
practice, says that the women of his time were “lying with
their eyes” (<span class="heb" title="meshaqerot" xml:lang="he">משקרות</span>,
from <span class="heb" title="sheqer" xml:lang="he">שקר</span>, Isa. iii. 16).
The Hebrew term for this paint is <i>puck</i>
(<span class="heb" title="pukh" xml:lang="he">פוך</span>), being equivalent in etymology
to <span xml:lang="grc" title="phykos">φῦκος</span> and <i>fucus</i> of the classics. The Hebrew women
must generally have been of great natural beauty, for many
such are found in the Old Testament. According to
Canticles (ch. ii), pet-names were often given to women,
such as <i>rose of the valley</i>, <i>dove</i>, <i>Aurora</i>, <i>sister</i>, <i>sun</i>, and <i>star</i>.
</p>

<p>
If the character of a nation is reflected in its proverbs,
the passages in the Bible relating to the worth of women
prove the high estimation in which the Hebrew women
were held by their husbands. They joined the latter at
meals (Job i. 4), and took part in their social life—a
privilege withheld from other Oriental women even at the
present day.
</p>

<p>
It is, therefore, evident that the common idea as to the
low position of the ancient Hebrew woman is incorrect.
She enjoyed, at all events, much greater freedom than was
permitted to the wives of the highly-cultured ancient
Greeks. She was held in higher regard than the women
<span class="pageno target" title="42" id="page-42"></span>
that lived in the time of Luther, who in his <i>Table Talk</i>
quotes, and as it seems approvingly, the old Latin proverb:
<i>Tria mala pessima: ignis, aqua, femina</i>. And finally,
the liberty granted by the Mosaic law to the Hebrew
women was never condemned by contemporary poets or
prophets, while modern writers and philosophers, such as
Hartmann, Schopenhauer, and others, do not hesitate to
inveigh against the privileges granted to them in modern
life. In the book <i>Über die Weiber</i> (<i>On Women</i>, vol. VI,
P. 549), Schopenhauer says that the low position of the
Oriental women suits them better than their freedom in
the West.
</p>

<p>
It is true that the Old Testament has its share of gossiping,
over-curious, quarrelsome, and superstitious women, but
they only form a small proportion to the large number of
model women that appear in its pages. The esteem in
which the Hebrew woman was held is shown throughout
the Bible, as the following few quotations from it will
prove:—“Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and
obtaineth favour of the Lord” (Prov. xviii. 22). “A gracious
woman retaineth honour, as the hand of the industrious
increaseth wealth” (ibid. xi. 16). “A virtuous woman is
a crown to her husband” (ibid. xii. 4). “House and riches
are the inheritance of fathers: but a prudent wife is from
God” (ibid. xix. 14).

<span class="subtitle">
<a href="#toc-return-V">CURIOSITIES OF CERTAIN PROPER NAMES IN THE BIBLE</a></span></h2>

<p>
<span class="begc">Shakespeare</span>, in one of his plays, asks “What's in a
name?” That he himself believed that there was a good
deal in a name is shown by his fondness for reading certain
characteristics into the personality of the possessors of
certain names. Thus, for example, in the dialogue between
King Richard and Gaunt (cp. <i>Richard II</i>, Act 2), the
former says:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">What comfort, man? How is it with aged Gaunt?</p>
    <p class="verse2"><i>Gaunt.</i> Oh, how that name befits my composition!</p>
    <p class="verse">Old Gaunt indeed, and <i>gaunt</i> in being old!</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
With this may be compared <a id="Falstaff"></a>Falstaff's remark in
<i>2 King Henry IV</i>, Act 3, Scene 2, where he says:—“I
told you John a Gaunt he beat his own name; for you
might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin.”
</p>

<p>
In Greek literature, too, several names occur which are
even more striking, inasmuch as they foreshadow the future
fate, and sometimes also the mental or physical disposition
of their bearers<a id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor"><sup>[43-1]</sup></a>. Similarly, certain Hebrew proper names
are found in the Old Testament, which are attended with
peculiar significance. So, for instance, in the name of the
first man <i>Adam</i> (<span class="heb" title="adam" xml:lang="he">אדם</span>,
from <span class="heb" title="adamah" xml:lang="he">אדמה</span>, “the earth”),
 the final
destiny of man seems to have been predicted. At a subsequent
period in Adam's life, this hidden allusion to his
future fate is made even more clear by the words: “For
<i>dust</i> art thou, and unto <i>dust</i> shalt thou return” (Gen. iii. 19).
</p>

<p>
Something similar is noticeable in connexion with the
first woman, <i>Eve</i>. She was first called <i>Ish-shah</i>
(<span class="heb" title="ishah" xml:lang="he">אשה</span>, from
<span class="pageno target" title="44" id="page-44"></span>
<span class="heb" title="ish" xml:lang="he">איש</span>)
“because she was taken out of man,” but subsequently,
after she had tasted of the “tree of knowledge,” her name
was changed into <span class="heb" title="Chava" xml:lang="he">חוה</span>
= “Eve” (from <span class="heb" title="chaya" xml:lang="he">חיה</span>,
“living”), which
is evidently a name showing that she was destined to
become “the mother of all living.” In the name of one of
her sons, <i>Abel</i> (<span class="heb" title="hevel" xml:lang="he">הבל</span>,
signifying “breath” or “nothingness”),
a prophetic prediction of his brief life seems to have been
expressed; and the names of the descendants of her second
son <i>Cain</i>, viz. <i>Jabal</i>, <i>Jubal</i>, and <i>Tubal</i>
(<span class="heb" title="Yaval" xml:lang="he">יבל</span>,
<span class="heb" title="Yuval" xml:lang="he">יובל</span>,
<span class="heb" title="Tuval" xml:lang="he">תובל</span>), indicated
their respective occupations after reaching manhood.
</p>

<p>
At a later period in Biblical times, we meet with the
names <i>Noah</i> (<span class="heb" title="Noach" xml:lang="he">נח</span>,
meaning “rest” or “comfort”), <i>Abram</i>
(<span class="heb" title="Avram" xml:lang="he">אברם</span>,
“the exalted father”), and <i>Sarah</i>
(<span class="heb" title="Sarah" xml:lang="he">שרה</span>,
“the princess”),
and it is interesting to notice how these names foretold the
future fate of their owners. There are three more proper
names in the Pentateuch, which belong to the same category,
viz. <i>Korah</i>, <i>Balaam</i>, and <i>Balak</i>. <i>Kerah</i>
signifies in the
original Hebrew “coldness,” exemplified by his apathy to
divine ordinances, when he brought about a rebellion
against the authority of Moses. It has also another
meaning in Hebrew, viz. “baldness,” and it is curious to
observe that it gave some ardent followers of the Church
of Rome a ready handle with which to banter Calvin (Lat.
<i>Calvus</i>, <i>Calvinus</i> = “bald”) as being homonymous with
his predecessor (<span class="heb" title="Korach" xml:lang="he">קרח</span>)
in schism (cf. Smith's <i>Dictionary of
the Bible</i>, sub <i>Korah</i>).
</p>

<p>
In the names of <i>Balaam</i> and <i>Balak</i>, some of the old
Jewish and Christian commentators on the Bible have
detected a particular meaning. In <i>Balaam</i>
(<span class="heb" title="bal'a-'am" xml:lang="he">בלע־עם</span>) they
saw a future “devourer,” or “destroyer of the people,”
and in <i>Balak</i> (<span class="heb" title="Balaq" xml:lang="he">בלק</span>)
a representation of “incompetence,”
illustrating their subsequent conduct towards the Jewish
people. Similarly, too, the name of <i>Achan</i> or <i>Achar</i>
(<span class="heb" title="Achar" xml:lang="he">עכר</span>)
(1 Chron. ii. 7), which latter word means “to cause trouble,”
and <i>Machlon</i> and <i>Chillion</i>
(<span class="heb" title="Machlon" xml:lang="he">מחלון</span>,
<span class="heb" title="Chilion" xml:lang="he">כליון</span>)
“the sick, the perishing,”
seem to be foretokens of the subsequent fortunes of
their owners.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="45" id="page-45"></span>
</div>

<p>
Interesting, again, is the name <i>David</i>
(<span class="heb" title="David" xml:lang="he">דוד</span>), which means
“the beloved one,” or “the friend,” and was given to the
child that subsequently became the sweet singer in
Israel. In connexion therewith a play on words may be
mentioned here, which seems to have hitherto been overlooked
by students of the Bible. When King Saul, who
hated David after his victory over Goliath, missed his presence
at the royal table, he asked his son Jonathan, “Wherefore
cometh not the son of Jesse to meat?”
(<span class="heb" title="el halechem" xml:lang="he">אל הלחם</span>).
Thereupon Jonathan ironically replied: “David has asked
leave of me to go to <i>Beth-lehem</i>”
(<span class="heb" title="Beth Lechem" xml:lang="he">בית לחם</span>).
By this play on
words Jonathan seems to have intended to tell his father
that David had a home of his own where there was plenty
of food (<span class="heb" title="lechem" xml:lang="he">לחם</span>),
and he could therefore readily dispense with
the hospitality of the royal palace.
</p>

<p>
This play on words is found elsewhere in the Bible, in
connexion with proper names, viz.
<span class="heb" title="batei achziv leachzav" xml:lang="he">בתי אכזיב לאכזב</span>,
“The houses of <i>Achzib</i>
(from <span class="heb" title="chazav" xml:lang="he">כזב</span>)
shall be a ‛lie’” (Mic. i. 14);
and <span class="heb" title="Eqron te'aqer" xml:lang="he">עקרון תעקר</span>,
“<i>Ekron</i>
(from <span class="heb" title="'aqar" xml:lang="he">עקר</span>)
shall be destroyed”
(Zeph. ii. 4). It is noticeable that the idol which the
inhabitants of the latter town used to worship was ignominiously
called in the Bible “<i>Baal-Zebub</i>”—“The Lord
of Flies.” It is said in 2 Kings i. 2, not without a slight
touch of irony, that King <i>Ahazia</i> had sent messengers to
this impotent deity to inquire about the issue of his
protracted illness.
</p>

<p>
There are four other proper names in the Bible which
have seemingly foretold the future characteristics of their
respective possessors. These are: <i>Solomon</i>
(<span class="heb" title="Shlomo" xml:lang="he">שלמה</span>), being a
name which signifies “Peace”
(from <span class="heb" title="shalom" xml:lang="he">שלום</span>);
<i>Malachi</i> (<span class="heb" title="Malachi" xml:lang="he">מלאכי</span>),
“My Messenger,” the future Jewish prophet; <i>Ezra</i>
(<span class="heb" title="'Ezra" xml:lang="he">עזרא</span>),
“The Helper”; and <i>Nehemia</i>
(<span class="heb" title="Nehemia" xml:lang="he">נחמיה</span>), “God's Comforter.”
The subsequent history of the two latter in leading back
to Palestine the bulk of the Jewish exiles from the
Babylonian captivity shows that their names were not
ill-bestowed.
</p>

<p>
There are also a few female proper names in the Bible of
<span class="pageno target" title="46" id="page-46"></span>
similar interest. Besides the names of <i>Eve</i> and <i>Sarah</i>, to
which reference has already been made, there is the name
<i>Miriam</i> (<span class="heb" title="Miriam" xml:lang="he">מרים</span>,
from <span class="heb" title="meri" xml:lang="he">מרי</span>, “rebellion”),
which suggests her
and her brother Aaron's revolt against Moses on the occasion
of his marrying the Cushite woman. Jacob's only daughter
was called <i>Dinah</i> (<span class="heb" title="Dinah" xml:lang="he">דינה</span>,
from <span class="heb" title="din" xml:lang="he">דין</span>), signifying “judgment,”
and that name seems to have foreshadowed punishment for
her unprotected wanderings. <i>Deborah</i>
(<span class="heb" title="Devorah" xml:lang="he">דבורה</span>), “The Bee,”
made the enemies of her race feel her sting in the great
battle that she fought against them. Another Biblical heroine,
<i>Hannah</i> (<span class="heb" title="Hannah" xml:lang="he">חנה</span>,
from <span class="heb" title="hwn" xml:lang="he">חון</span>, “to pray,”
or <span class="heb" title="hanan" xml:lang="he">חנן</span>, “to be favoured”),
afterwards received that favour which her name prognosticated.
She longed and prayed for a son, whose life was to
be wholly devoted to the service of God, and her prayer
was favourably received. She subsequently became the
mother of Samuel, who was the first of the regular and
unbroken succession of prophets.

<a href="#toc-return-VI">SKETCH OF THE TALMUD</a></span></h2>

<p>
<span class="begc">The</span> old proverb “Habent sua fata libelli” is perhaps
nowhere more strikingly illustrated than in the Talmud. This
gigantic literary work has a peculiar history of its own.
Now honoured, now decried, it has been at once the study
of the scholar, the butt of the sceptic, and the scapegoat of
the bigot.
</p>

<p>
In the Middle Ages, some of the high dignitaries of the
Roman Church thundered their anathemas against it, and
caused edition after edition to be publicly burnt. What
strikes one most is their profound ignorance of its real
contents. They were satisfied to condemn it on hearsay
evidence, or on the strength of some garbled quotations.
Henricus Seynensis, a Capucin friar, having heard a good
deal about the heretical Talmud, took it to be a Rabbi, and
swore that he would ere long have him put to death by
the common executioner. The censor, too, whose duty it
was to amend any passage or expression found in the
Talmud which might be construed in a sense hostile to the
representatives of the Roman Church, displayed, as a rule,
more zeal than erudition. Thus, for the Talmud to say, for
instance, that a Roman swore by the Capitol or by Jupiter,
was sufficient for the censor to find a hidden allusion to the
Vatican or the Pope, and to alter the nomenclature, so that
the Roman swore by the capital of Persia, or by the God
of Babylon. This substitution of inappropriate names
rendered many passages obscure, and this is one of the
chief reasons why the Talmud has been repeatedly condemned
as an unintelligible and nonsensical production.
The great majority, however, of modern scholars, theologians,
and orientalists read the Talmud, not to refute it, but
<span class="pageno target" title="48" id="page-48"></span>
rather to bring to light the vast store of knowledge hidden
therein. And yet, in spite of the many allusions there are
to it in theology, in Biblical lore, and in sacred geography,
it still is to the majority of students a sealed book. The
object of this essay is therefore to sketch in outline its
essence and character, and to give some idea of its subject-matter.
</p>

<p>
The year 70 of the common era was a most disastrous
one for the Jews. After having bravely struggled against
the formidable armies of Vespasian and Titus for their
national independence, they had finally to submit to their
conqueror. The holy Temple of Jerusalem, in which
their religious, political, and civil life was centred, was
reduced to a heap of ashes before their very eyes, and from
that time forth their nationality was destroyed, and they
remained without a king and without a fatherland. Other
nations, whose vitality was less prominent, might in such
circumstances have disappeared from the face of the earth.
Not so the Jews. When the time for their national dispersion
arrived, they abandoned the sword for the pen. In
the seclusion of the new homes they had made for themselves
in Persia and Syria, they devoted all their energies
to the study of their literature. Their leaders founded there
colleges and schools, in which the sacred flame of learning
was kept aglow in the midst of the darkness of the times.
The Bible was still in their hands, that sacred treasure
which gave them solace for the tribulations of the past,
and patience and hope for the uncertainties of the future.
From that time forth it remained the centre of their mental
activity. In spite of the fact that the Romans had fixed
the penalty of death as a punishment for any one that
imparted instruction in the Bible, teachers were not wanting
who taught its doctrines publicly to large numbers of pupils.
One of them, Rabbi Akiba by name, being asked by
a friend why he continued to expound the law publicly at
the peril of his life, replied in the following parable:—“Once
upon a time a fox was walking along the river side,
<span class="pageno target" title="49" id="page-49"></span>
when he saw the fish swimming to and fro in great consternation.
He asked them what was the matter, and what
they were afraid of, whereupon they pointed to the nets,
which were spread out to catch them. Thereupon the fox
advised them to come to live with him on dry land, and be
safe.” But the fish replied: “Thou wilt never persuade
us to follow thy advice, for if in our element, the water,
we have good cause for fear, surely, when we depart from
this element, the danger will be even greater.” “So it is
with us” (said Rabbi Akiba); “if our life is imperilled while
our mind remains fixed on the study of the Bible, which is
the soul of our existence, how much greater must our danger
be, when we leave our element and cease to study.”
</p>

<p>
At this time, the mental activity of the Rabbis was confined
to the exposition and investigation of the text of the
Scriptures, which they called the “written law.” But a
little later their attention was also directed to the study
of the “unwritten law,” or oral traditions, to which
reference is sometimes made in the Pentateuch. Thus
a new sphere of activity was opened to them, which soon
begot a science, embracing diverse branches of study, and
rising by degrees to very large proportions. The mode of
teaching adopted by these masters was somewhat similar
to that employed by Socrates. Questions were put and
answered, and the decisions of the teachers were committed
to memory by the pupils. This method, however, had the
disadvantage attendant upon constant migration. Rabbi
Jehuda, surnamed “the Prince,” thereupon, towards the
early part of the third century of the common era, collected
all the floating dicta of the sages, together with the large
mass of law and rulings, and recorded them for the first
time in writing. In this way a code was drawn up, the
materials of which the editor divided into six sections.
The first section is named “Seeds,” and treats principally
of agrarian laws. The second, called “Feasts,” contains the
ordinances relating to the Sabbath and festivals. The
third, entitled “Women,” deals chiefly with marriage and
<span class="pageno target" title="50" id="page-50"></span>
divorce. The fourth, called “Damages,” discusses civil and
criminal law. The fifth is named “Holiness,” and treats of
sacred things, such as the Temple, sacrifices, &amp;c. The last
section, entitled “Purification,” deals with various Levitical
and sanitary laws. The whole collection was then called
<i>Mishna</i> (from <i>shannah</i>, “to study”), which means “learning
or teaching.” As in process of time a great many new
traditions sprang up, the <i>Mishna</i> formed the materials for
a new compilation which is called the <i>Talmud</i>, sometimes
also the <i>Gemara</i>. Both names have the same signification—study
and learning; the only difference between them is,
that the word Talmud is derived from the Hebrew, and
Gemara from the Syrian language. There are two
Talmuds—the Jerusalem and the Babylonian. The first
was compiled at the beginning of the fourth century of the
common era, from the decisions of the colleges in Palestine,
and the second from those of the Academy of Sora in
Babylonia.
</p>

<p>
Rabbi Ashe, who lived at the end of the fifth century <span class="bc">A. D.</span>,
is mentioned as the editor of the Babylonian Talmud.
This is the Talmud <i>par excellence</i>, and is about four
times as large as that of Jerusalem. It covers 5,154 folio
pages in twelve folio volumes. This gigantic work became
the bed-rock of Jewish literature for many centuries, and
was at the same time the link that kept the Jewish community
together during the years of their persecution in
various countries. A few characteristics of this most
important work may be mentioned. The Talmud is, as the
late Emanuel Deutsch has it, a microcosm, embracing, as
even the Bible does, heaven and earth. It is a republic of
literature, and a library in itself. It treats of law, history,
medicine, astronomy, mathematics, legend, social life, theosophy,
and metaphysics. It passes from myth to morality,
from legend to logic, from grave to gay, from lively to
severe topics. The Talmud is a product of those centuries
when the Jews were considered beyond the pale of
the law, and it tells the story of the stormy life of thirty
<span class="pageno target" title="51" id="page-51"></span>
generations. Though at first sight it might appear to be
written without method and system, it will soon be seen that
it is composed of two elements—the legal and the legendary,
or prose and poetry. The first is called <i>Halacha</i> or
legal decisions, and the second <i>Agada</i> or moral maxims
and legends. As regards the Halacha, it is obvious that
its laws, its spirit, and its details, cannot be adequately
analysed within the limits of a short essay. We therefore
propose to make some observations merely on the two
highly important subjects of education and capital punishment.
Basing their argument on the ordinance found in
the Bible that every parent is obliged to have his children
properly trained, the masters laid down the rule that
education should be compulsory. If a child, they say, is
idle, and does not wish to study, he is not to be chastised
too severely; but he is to remain sitting among those
children who are industrious and attentive, that he may
follow their good example. The chastisement of children in
schools was unknown in the Talmud. The principal maxim
of these masters was as follows: “Above all things study.
Whether for the sake of learning, or for any other reason,
study; for whatever the motive that may impel you at
first, you will very soon love study for its own sake.”
</p>

<p>
Respecting the criminal legislation of the Talmud, it may
be observed that nowhere in its pages are any traces to be
found of the use of the rack or of any other kind of torture
to compel the accused to implicate himself. The judges
were obliged, according to the Talmud, to search for innocence
rather than for guilt. To judge a man charged with
a capital crime, no less than twenty judges had to be
selected from among the most eminent doctors of law; so
extreme was the care taken of human life. The examination
of witnesses in such a case was so rigorous that a
sentence of capital punishment became almost impossible.
The Talmud goes even so far as to declare that the tribunal
which imposes the penalty of death once in seven or even
seventy years, is a court of murderers. Thus it will be seen
<span class="pageno target" title="52" id="page-52"></span>
that the severity of the Mosaic code had been modified
by the influence of these oral conditions, which tell us also
that “paying measure for measure” is in God's hands only,
and that he who has sustained any bodily injuries must
rest satisfied with an indemnification of money.
</p>

<p>
Equally interesting, and much more entertaining, is the
second portion of the Talmud—the Agada. It is, as already
stated, the poetry of the Talmud. It contains fairy tales
and words of wisdom, plays of fancy and jests, parables
and legends. The patriarchs and some of the kings and
prophets of the Bible were mostly the characters from
whom the allegories of the Agada were derived. So, for
example, of Solomon, a favourite hero of the Agada, the
following pleasant little story is told: “This monarch was
once visited by Queen Sheba, who wished to ascertain in
person whether all was true that was said about him. So
she appeared one day before him in his palace, holding in
each hand a bouquet of flowers. And though one was
natural and the other artificial, their resemblance to each
other was so great that it was impossible to tell from
a distance which was the production of nature, and which
of art. This, however, Solomon had to decide. Observing,
by chance, a swarm of bees hovering about outside, he
ordered the windows to be opened, and as soon as this was
done, the bees rushed in, and at once fixed on the natural
flowers. Queen Sheba was satisfied with the genuine
wisdom of the Jewish monarch.” From this story, says one
of the humorous Agadaists, a good moral lesson can be
derived, if applied to ladies generally, namely, that the bee
only rests on the natural beauties, and never fixes on the
painted ones<a id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor"><sup>[52-1]</sup></a>.
</p>

<p>
The Agada tells another story about King Solomon. He
had the reputation of understanding every language in
existence, including that of the animal world, and once
heard a bird talking to his mate that was sitting on the
<span class="pageno target" title="53" id="page-53"></span>
dome of the Temple. “If,” he said, “I were to stamp my
foot hard, the whole Temple would collapse in a moment.”
Hearing this grandiloquent remark, King Solomon called
the male bird, and assuming an angry look, asked him
what he meant by such language. Trembling with fear,
the bird excused himself, saying that he merely wished to
tell his mate how strong he was. After being cautioned
not to be so boastful in future, the bird returned to his
wife, who was anxiously awaiting his return. And on her
asking him what the great king wanted of him, he answered
and said: “King Solomon urgently implored me not to
destroy his beautiful Temple.”
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the Agada occupies itself with the exposition
of certain Biblical passages, which take the form of
homilies. Thus, for instance, quoting the passage in Jeremiah
xlvi. 28: “Fear thou not, my servant Jacob, for
I am with thee; I will make a full end of all the nations
by whom thou art oppressed, but of thee I will never make
a full end,” the Agada speaks to the Jewish people living
in exile: “Thou art grieved,” it says, “that thy Temple is
destroyed, and that thy sons and daughters are scattered
and dispersed to all quarters of the globe. But the Temple
of God is the whole universe, and wherever thou wilt
address thyself to him in prayer, he will listen to thee
most graciously. Therefore, though thou art in a strange
land, do not forsake the God of thy fathers; erect schools
and colleges, and keep up the flame of knowledge in thy
midst. Let this flame be a substitute for thy fire-offering,
and thy heart a substitute for the altar of old. Both can
be replaced by good actions. If thou hast taken pity on
the poor and needy, and by consoling words thou hast
soothed the grief of the widow and the orphan; or if by
any charitable work thou hast saved even one life from
misery and degradation, thou hast done a nobler deed unto
thy God than if thou hadst offered him a thousand sacrifices.
Thou art grieved because thy priests are no more;
but it lies within thy power and that of every Israelite to
<span class="pageno target" title="54" id="page-54"></span>
lead as holy a life as they did. Let each man among you
be a disciple of the High Priest Aaron, a friend of peace,
a promoter of peace, and a friend of all men, and he will
be as agreeable to God as the High Priest himself. Thou
art scorned, ridiculed, and persecuted; the nations among
whom thou livest try to get rid of thee; their leaders and
statesmen treat thy race like a horde of outcasts; but do
not despair of a better end. For the time is not far distant
when the dawn of brighter days will break; when the
rays of an enlightened age will disperse all the clouds of
ignorance and superstition, and then thou wilt shine again
in the golden sun of liberty<a id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor"><sup>[54-1]</sup></a>.”
</p>

<p>
In another place the Agada quotes a proverb of its own:
“Never cast a stone into a well out of which thou hast
drunk.” And after having reminded every Israelite of his
duty to be grateful even to inanimate things of Nature
from which he has ever derived any benefit, it addresses
the peoples of the world, saying—“Had you acted on this
principle, how much better would the treatment have been
which Judaism and its confessors have ever received at
your hands! Have not the books of our poets and prophets
served as an ever flowing source of religious truth and
morality, offering at the same time consolation and hope to
millions of your people in times of sorrow and distress?
And why did you cast stones into the well which has so
often quenched your thirst for religious and ethical
knowledge?”
</p>

<p>
Seeing that, even at the present day, some curious ideas
prevail as to the domestic and social position occupied
by the Hebrew woman in Talmudical times, it may be of
interest to see what the Agada has to say on this point.
It appears that Hebrew maidens used to go out into the
fields and vineyards on a certain day in the year, clad
alike in white garments, so that there might be no distinction
between the wealthy and the poor, and there they
invited the young men of the <a id="neighbourhood"></a>neighbourhood
to dance with
<span class="pageno target" title="55" id="page-55"></span>
them; and it was their privilege on these occasions to propose
marriage to their partners, stating at the same time
their different advantages. Those who could boast of their
noble birth, or who were distinguished for their personal
charms, boldly drew attention to their attractions. The
less well-favoured dwelt upon the value of enduring love
and the happiness which they were prepared to offer to
those young men who would choose them for their wives.
There is other evidence in the Talmud which shows that
the Hebrew woman, unlike Orientals, enjoyed comparative
freedom in public, and was likewise allowed to take part in
domestic and social affairs. It is true that polygamy was
then still legally permitted, but it existed only in theory,
and had ceased to be generally practised long before it was
wholly interdicted. A witty Agadaist tells us the following
tale regarding the evil consequences of polygamy: “An
elderly man, whose hair had already begun to turn grey,
married two wives, one of them young and beautiful, the
other old and plain. The latter, thinking that her husband
would be fonder of her if he looked as old as she did,
pulled out all the black hairs in his head. Her younger
rival, acting on the same principle, removed all his grey
hairs. The consequence was that, in course of time, the
unfortunate husband had no hair left on his head at all,
and whenever he made his appearance he was held up to
mockery and derision<a id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor"><sup>[55-1]</sup></a>.” The masters have some witty
sayings about womanhood generally. “Ten measures of
talk,” they say, “came down to the world. Women received
nine measures for their own use, and the rest of the
world one measure.” Commenting on the passage in Genesis,
“And God formed the rib, which he had taken from the
man, into a wife,” another humorous Agadaist says: “She
was not formed out of a man's head, in order that she
might not be proud and keep her head too high; not out
of his eye or ear, that she should not be curious, wishing
to see and hear everything; not out of his mouth, that she
<span class="pageno target" title="56" id="page-56"></span>
might not be too talkative; not out of his heart, that she
should not be jealous; and finally, not out of his hand and
foot, in order that she might not touch everything nor go
everywhere. To avoid all these contingencies, she was
formed out of his rib, that is hidden from sight, and might
serve as an emblem of modesty and virtue.”
</p>

<p>
The Agada is especially rich in pithy maxims, which
bear on everyday life, and have a permanent ethical value.
The following specimens will give an idea of the contents
of some of the rest:—“Who is strong? He who subdues
his passion.” “Who is rich? He who is satisfied with
his lot.” “Morning slumber, midday wine, and idle talk
with the ignorant destroy a man's life.” “Do not be near
a pious fool.” “Luck makes rich, luck makes wise.” “It
is not the place that honours the man, but the man who
honours the place.” “What is hateful to thee, do not unto
thy neighbour.” “Charity is the most important part of
divine worship.”
</p>

<p>
Commenting on the last-mentioned maxim, a moralizing
Agadaist quotes the following:—“There once lived a man
in the East, who had three friends, two of whom he loved
very dearly, but the third he neglected. Once he was
summoned before the judge, where, though innocent, he
was accused of a serious crime. ‘Who amongst you,’ he
said to his friends, ‘will go with me, and plead my
cause?’ The first friend excused himself immediately,
and said that he could not go on account of other pressing
engagements. The second went with him as far as the gate
of the courthouse, and then he turned and went home. But
the third, whom he had always ignored, went into the
court, appealed to the judge on behalf of his friend, and
obtained his pardon. Man has three friends in the world—wealth,
relations, and good deeds. How do they behave in
the hour of death, when God summons him before his
tribunal? The wealth, which was his best friend in life,
leaves him first, and goes not with him. His relations and
friends accompany him to the brink of the grave, and then
<span class="pageno target" title="57" id="page-57"></span>
return to their homes. His good works, however, which
he used to neglect during his lifetime, accompany him as
far as the throne of the All-merciful Father of men, where
they speak for him, plead his cause, and obtain for him
God's favour and grace.”
</p>

<p>
From all that has been said it will be seen what a wonderful
work the Talmud is, and that many a legend,
allegory, and maxim found in ancient and modern literature
has flowed from the realms of its boundless fancy. But
the student who wishes to get an insight into this treasure-house
of Rabbinical literature, should not feel discouraged
if his early researches seem to yield him nothing but dross.
One of the Jewish sages once compared the Talmud to the
sea. As the moods of the sea vary, so do those of the
Talmud. Many a student has dived into this vast sea of
learning and has brought up nothing but a handful of
empty shells; but there are others, whose searchings have
been wider and deeper, that have won for themselves pearls
of the finest water, and of considerable value.

<a href="#toc-return-VII">THE HUMOUR OF SOME MEDIAEVAL AND MODERN HEBREW WRITERS</a></span></h2>

<p>
<span class="begc">After</span> the disintegration of the Jewish
state in 70 <span class="bc">A. D.</span>
a large number of refugees went to live in Spain, in that
land of flowers and sunshine that was already known in
Biblical times under the name of Tarshish. There they
lived happily for several centuries, under the rule of various
Gothic kings, until one of them, Reccared by name, who
lived in 590, embraced Christianity. This was the commencement
of a prolonged period of religious intolerance,
which continued till the invasion and conquest of Spain
by the Moors in 711 <span class="bc">A. D.</span>, when religious independence was
proclaimed. The privileges thus obtained were a direct
incentive to the Jews to participate in the literary and
scientific life that flourished round them under the immediate
protection of the high-minded Caliphs. The finest
productions of Jewish thought were brought to light
through the cordial friendship which they entertained for
their Mohammedan neighbours, and their friendly intercourse
resulted in far-reaching advantages to both of them.
The Arabs, by this means, became acquainted with the
beautiful legends and maxims found in the Rabbinical
writings, a good many of which they subsequently used
as material for enriching their own literature; while the
Jews gained an insight into the beauties of the Arabic
poetry, which they, in their turn, essayed to imitate in
Hebrew. The Spanish era, which extended over more
than six centuries, may be justly called the golden age in
<span class="pageno target" title="59" id="page-59"></span>
the post-Biblical history of the Jews. For, while nearly
the whole of Europe was during that time plunged in the
depths of ignorance and superstition, Spanish Judaism
distinguished itself by its efforts within the field of
original classical work. In fact, had it not been for the
labours of the Spanish Jews in handing over to the
West some of the literary treasures of the East, together
with those of the Greeks and Romans, it is doubtful
whether these valuable works would have been preserved
to us.
</p>

<p>
The principal representatives of the Spanish Hebrew
poets were—Solomon Ibn Gabirol, Abraham Ibn Ezra,
Jehuda Halevi, and Jehuda Alcharizi. But as their lives
and works have already been largely dealt with by several
eminent scholars, it is only proposed to give here a few
specimens of their humour.
</p>

<p>
Solomon Ibn Gabirol, who was born in Malaga in 1020,
acquired the reputation of being a profound philosopher,
but his special claim to recognition rests on his poetry.
The leading characteristic of his verse is its sadness,
although some of his poems were written in a vein of
pure humour. His poem entitled <i>Kether Malchus</i> (the
Royal Crown) is undoubtedly one of his best poetic compositions.
It has for its theme the loftiest of subjects—God,
the Universe, and Man. Humboldt considers it to be
the noblest monument of Neo-Hebraic poetry, inasmuch
as it contains vivid flashes which recall the poetical
inspiration of the prophets.
</p>

<p>
Ibn Gabirol's humour is, however, best represented in
his famous “Wine-song,” which he composed at a banquet
given to him by a wealthy but niggardly man called
Moses. Gabirol and the other guests had nothing
offered to them to drink but water, and indignant thereat
he wrote a few stanzas, the refrain of which was easily
taken up and chanted by the whole company. The
song runs in a free English translation somewhat as
follows:—

<p>
Gabirol died when he was only about thirty years of
age. It is said that a Moor, who fancied himself to be a
great poet, being jealous of Gabirol's success, which he was
<span class="pageno target" title="61" id="page-61"></span>
unable to equal, invited him to his house on a dark night
and put him to death.
</p>

<p>
Abraham Ibn Ezra (1088–1167) achieved a certain
amount of fame because of the genuine humour which
characterized both his prose and verse. Like so many
other men of genius, Ibn Ezra had all his life been in very
straitened circumstances, but he never permitted his ill-fortune
or disappointments to interfere with his natural
cheerfulness. His is the courage which laughs at misfortunes.
Thus he writes:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">In vain I labour, all my toil is vain,</p>
    <p class="verse">For never can I boast of riches' gain;</p>

    <p class="verse">The sun would shine by night as well as day<a id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor"><sup>[61-1]</sup></a>.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
When Ibn Ezra saw that it was impossible for him to
earn a livelihood in his native country, he determined to
try his fortune abroad. He thus visited Egypt at the time
when the famous Maimonides was the physician at the
Court of the Sultan Saladin. He made several vain
attempts to see him, and in the end he composed the
following epigram:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">I call on my Lord in the morning,</p>
    <p class="verse">I am told that on horse-back he's sped;</p>
    <p class="verse">I call once again in the evening,</p>
    <p class="verse">And hear that his lordship's abed.</p>
    <p class="verse">But whether his Highness is riding,</p>
    <p class="verse">Or whether my Lord is asleep,</p>
    <p class="verse">I'm perfectly sure, disappointment</p>
    <p class="verse">Is the one single fruit I shall reap<a id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor"><sup>[61-2]</sup></a>.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
More fortunate as regards worldly possessions was
Jehuda Halevi, the most celebrated Hebrew poet since the
<span class="pageno target" title="62" id="page-62"></span>
close of the Hebrew Canon. Born in Toledo, in Spain,
about the end of the eleventh century, he received an
excellent education, and his genius showed itself very
early. Though following the medical profession with conspicuous
success, he is chiefly known as the author of some
philosophical works and of numerous charming poems in
Hebrew. Some of them have been made familiar to the
literary world by Heinrich Heine, who speaks of their
author as follows:—“When his soul was on the point of
leaving heaven, she was kissed by the Creator. This kiss
re-echoed afterwards in the poet's mind, and vibrated in
all the poetical offsprings of his genius.”
</p>

<p>
Particularly fine is the sacred song which Jehuda Halevi
composed under the title of “An Ode to Zion,” a condensed
version of which in prose runs somewhat as follows:—
</p>

<p>
“Hast thou, O Zion, forsaken thy captive children?
Hearest thou not the heartfelt greetings thy flock sendeth
thee from the end of the earth? They look to thee with
longing hearts, and from year to year they shed their tears
on thy beautiful hills and mountains. Had I but wings
I would fly to thy ruins, that my head might touch thy
sacred ground, and my feet rest on the holy tombs of my
fathers. In thy fragrant air I should breathe the breath
of life, and inhale the perfume of thy dust, and eagerly
I should drink the sweet waters of thy streams. O
Zion, crown of beauty, towards thee are bent the hearts
of thy lovers; they rejoice in thy joy, and weep with thee
in the days of thine affliction. Towards thy gates they
pour forth their fervent prayers, and long for the shade of
thy palm-trees. Oh thrice happy mortal, who shall live
to see the dawn of thy renewed glory, and be present
when thou wilt shine again in splendour and beauty as in
the days of thy youth.”
</p>

<p>
Jehuda Halevi has also written a considerable number of
secular poems and songs, having love, friendship, and the
joys of life for their theme. Some of them are light and
humorous, as the following lines will show:—

The last of the famous quartette of Spanish Hebrew
poets living in the Middle Ages, exclusive of the famous
Moses Ibn Ezra, was Jehuda ben Shelomoh Alcharizi. He
flourished in Spain in the first half of the thirteenth
century, and was famous in his day not only as a linguist
and philosopher, but even more so as a master of sparkling
rhymed prose and verse. His reputation rests chiefly on
his charming book entitled <i>Tachkemoni</i>, which consists of
fifty chapters, having for their model the peculiar form of
the so-called Makāma, which the author has adopted from
his favourite Arabic poet, Al Hariri. Alcharizi and his
<i>Tachkemoni</i> have in modern times been exhaustively criticized,
so that there is very little left to be said about
him. A specimen of his humour may, however, be aptly
given here; it is an extract from the sixth Makāma of the
<i>Tachkemoni</i>, which is called “The Unlucky Marriage.”

<p>
“Thus relate Hayman the Esrachite:—While living in
<span class="pageno target" title="64" id="page-64"></span>
Tarbez, a town pleasantly situated in the East, I sat one
day in one of the public bazaars in company with some
friends. I suddenly noticed among the crowd a haggard
man whom I soon recognized as Heber the Kenite, an
old and intimate friend of my youth. I quickly ran up to
him, and amidst cordial greetings and embraces I questioned
him about the state of his health, and about his
intended plans for the future. At the same time I suggested
to him that he should settle down in my neighbourhood,
so that I could look after him, and even assist
him in making a suitable marriage. When Heber heard
my last remark, he sighed deeply, and said: ‘Dear friend,
I entreat you with all my heart and soul not to induce
me to get married to any woman, for my past experiences
of wedlock have been so painful that I should not like to
have them repeated.’ And on my pressing him to let
me know what had happened, he told me the following
tale:—
</p>

<p>
“‘Some time ago, it so happened that I was rather depressed
in mind at my lonely bachelor state, and thus
I resolved to enter upon matrimonial life, which I fancied
would bring me happiness and contentment to my heart's
desire. This pleasant thought at once took hold of me,
and being unable to stay in the house, I rushed out into
the street in search of some imaginary pretty girl, whom
I intended to marry, and be happy with ever after. Presently
an old and mysterious-looking woman came up, and
greeting me humbly, addressed me as follows:—“May
God be with you, young man, and grant you a long and
prosperous life. From afar I have closely watched you,
and admired your handsome face and erect figure. But
you seem to be sad, and in want of a lively companion
whom you would call your wife. Now I know a most
beautiful maiden in town, who would be a suitable match
for you. She belongs to an excellent family, is highly
accomplished, and, as for her looks, they are simply fascinating,
and especially her eyes send forth a glorious
<span class="pageno target" title="65" id="page-65"></span>
light, like the lovely stars in a cloudless sky. Happy will
the man be who will succeed in winning her love, but this
can only be done if he assigns to her a dowry of two
thousand ducats, payable to her father on the day of her
marriage.”’
</p>

<p>
“After a short pause my friend Heber went on to relate
the story of his strange adventure, saying:—
</p>

<p>
“‘The glorious description given to me by the old woman
of my future bride caused my heart to beat loudly within
me, and in answer I said that I would willingly agree to
pay the stipulated sum of two thousand ducats, if I could
only first obtain a glimpse of the lovely girl who was to be
my wife. But the woman hurried away, having assured
me that my desire would be fulfilled on the following day,
when everything would also be ready for the celebration of
the marriage ceremony. Thereupon I went home in a most
agitated state and passed a sleepless night, looking forward
to the happy morning when I expected to meet my charming
bride. Next day, at an early hour, the old woman
made her appearance, and told me, with a beaming face,
that my future father-in-law would soon be here to give his
consent to the wedding. And hardly had she said so, when the
door of my room opened, and my future father-in-law came
in, accompanied by several elders of the community, whom
he addressed as follows:—“Brethren and friends, this young
man here, who is well off and belongs to a good family, is
desirous of marrying my daughter, and of assigning to her
a dowry of two thousand ducats. Be ye now witnesses
that I fully consent to this proposed marriage, and that
I readily accept the amount of the dowry which he has
promised to pay for the privilege of enjoying the advantage
of our near relationship.”
</p>

<p>
“‘I was about to remonstrate against these proceedings,
when the marriage contract was quickly thrust into my
hands which, after some hesitation, I duly signed and
handed over to the notary who was present. Thereupon
the preparations were soon made for the wedding ceremony
<span class="pageno target" title="66" id="page-66"></span>
and its subsequent feast, which were to take place in the
evening of that very day. When it got dark the wedding
guests arrived, and brought with them the fair maiden that
was to become my lawful wife. Her face was covered with
a thick veil, and thus standing close to me, the wedding
ceremony was solemnized in the usual way. Then the
feasting and merry-making began, and lasted for some time.
But gradually the crowd of the wedding guests disappeared,
and when I was left alone with my wife, I blushingly
spoke to her for the first time the following tender words:
“Oh, thou fairest of women, remove the veil from thy sweet
face, that I may behold and admire the beautiful eyes which
shine like the stars in a cloudless sky.” She removed her
veil; then lo, and behold, what an awakening! The
female that stood there before me was not a fair maiden
with softly shining eyes, but rather a monster in female
guise, who had a fierce and threatening look about her,
and filled me with feelings of horror and consternation.
Presently recovering from my shock, I asked my wife
whether she had any trinkets and jewels, costly robes, and
precious shawls that had been given to her by her father as
a dowry. In a husky voice she answered: “I have assuredly
left a large bundle in my father's house, which is filled with
veils and slippers, nightcaps and aprons, and several other
things that my poor departed mother had bequeathed to
me as my marriage portion. All these things are there
ready for my immediate use.”’
</p>

<p>
“After a few minutes' silence, my friend Heber concluded
his story as follows: ‘On hearing the shrill voice of my
wife, and the description she gave me of her wedding outfit,
I got mad with rage. Like a flash I rushed out of the
house, and ran all night on the road until I came to a thick
forest, which afforded me shelter till the following morning,
when I continued my flight from the unlovely society of my
spouse. Since that fearful night I am wandering from
place to place, and all that I ask of you, my friend, is, to
let me go away in peace.’”

<p>
Light humour is also frequently met with in certain little
Hebrew poems extant, which end in a “point,” especially of
the satirical kind. They are somewhat similar in form and
construction to the epigrams found in ancient and modern
literatures, and are termed in modern Hebrew <i>Michtamim</i>.
They form, according to Steinschneider<a id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor"><sup>[67-1]</sup></a>, an important
branch of Neo-Hebrew literature, and rival in excellence
and copiousness any other class of epigrams in existence.
</p>

<p>
Hebrew epigrams have both mediaeval and modern
Jewish writers for their authors, and the following rendering
into English of some of them will give the reader an
approximate idea of their contents.

A frequent charge preferred against Jewish literature by
modern critics<a id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor"><sup>[70-2]</sup></a> is, that it is deficient of humour. The
instances given in this essay, as well as in some others
forming part of the present volume may, perhaps, contribute
in some small degree to dissipate this fallacy.

There is also in existence a witty epigram composed by the same

to an ever-flowing stream, which continues its course, and does not mind
if some poor mortal draws from it now and again a bucketful of water.

<a href="#toc-return-VIII">YEDAYA BEDARESI</a></span></h2>

<p class="subtitle2">
A FOURTEENTH-CENTURY HEBREW POET
AND PHILOSOPHER</p>

<p>
<span class="begc">The</span> year 1306 was a fateful one in the annals of the
Jews in France. At the beginning of that year Philip IV,
surnamed <i>Le Bel</i>, issued an edict of expulsion against all
the Jews living in his dominions. The edict practically
confiscated all their property, and its terms were so rigorous
that any Israelite found on French soil after a certain time
became liable to the penalty of death.
</p>

<p>
Philip's mandate was promptly executed by the royal
officers, and some 100,000 Jews were mercilessly driven out
from their native land—a land in which their forefathers had
resided long before Christianity had become the dominant
religion there. In consequence of this expulsion, several
famous Jewish seats of learning, such as those at Béziers,
Lunel, and Montpellier ceased to exist. Among the refugees
was Yedaya En-Bonet ben Abraham Bedaresi, the subject
of the present essay. Yedaya, known also under the
poetical pseudonym of Penini, has left no documentary
evidence concerning the incidents of his life. The best
biography, however, of a man like Yedaya is that which is
found in his own works. There is some diversity of
opinion among biographers as to the exact date of Yedaya's
birth, for while Bartolocci, Wolf, and de Rossi say that he
was born in 1298, Steinschneider and Neubauer put the
year of his birth between 1255 and 1260, without, however,
attempting to fix the year of his death. Graetz, again,
maintains that Yedaya was born in 1280, and died about
1340, and that his birthplace was Béziers and not Barcelona,
<span class="pageno target" title="72" id="page-72"></span>
as some biographers believe<a id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor"><sup>[72-1]</sup></a>. The only indisputable fact
in connexion with Yedaya's early education is that he
entered the school of Rabbi Meshullam of Péziers when he
was fifteen years old. From Yedaya's numerous writings
it is obvious that he was a philosopher and moralist, a
Talmudical scholar and an expert in medicine, and above
all a clever writer of Hebrew prose and poetry. It is
chiefly to his ability in this direction that he owes his
prominent position among the Jewish savants of the Middle
Ages, and for that reason special attention will have to be
paid in the course of this essay to his chief work entitled
<i>Bechînath Olam</i>, “The Examination of the World.” It
is true that Graetz finds fault with this poetical composition,
which he condemns for its empty grandiloquence and
artificiality. But, on the other hand, Munk, in his
<i>Mélanges</i>, p. 495, and Buxtorf, in his <i>Bibliotheca Rabbinica</i>,
speak very highly of Yedaya's poetical talent; and the latter
calls “The Examination of the World” an excellent literary
production. And, indeed, the same opinion will be shared
by all those readers of the <i>Bechînath Olam</i> who, like
Munk and Buxtorf, are not prejudiced against it, on the
ground that its style is not so pure, elegant, and clear as
that met with in some of the writings of the most prominent
representatives of the so-called Spanish and Italian schools
of Hebrew poetry. It has, in fact, always enjoyed an extraordinary
popularity among the Jews; and it is remarkable
to notice the comparatively large number of MSS. of the
original, and of the commentaries on it, which are to be
found in various libraries. It may further be mentioned
that it has passed through more than forty-four editions,
issued both with and without commentaries, at various times
and in various countries, and has been frequently translated
into German and into Jargon, while there were Latin,
English, French, Italian, and Polish versions as well. It is
interesting to note that the eleventh and twelfth chapters
of one of the German editions, issued at Prague in 1795
<span class="pageno target" title="73" id="page-73"></span>
by Moses Kunitz, were rendered into German by Moses
Mendelssohn; and that the French translation, published
in Paris in 1629 by Ph. d'Aquin, was dedicated to Cardinal
Richelieu. The English version, which appeared in London
in 1806, was inscribed by its author, Rabbi Tobias Goodman,
to “The Most Reverend Solomon Hirschell, Presiding
Rabbi of the German Jews”; and the Latin one, which
has for its title <i>Examen mundi, R. J. Bedrishitae, latina
interpretatione</i>, was done by Uchtman, and issued at
Leyden in 1650.
</p>

<p>
Curiously enough the editor of the first of the forty-four
known editions of the <i>Bechînath Olam</i>, printed, as some
biographers think, at Mantua between 1476 and 1480, was
a lady called Estellina, the wife of a certain Abraham
Conath. She was assisted in her task by Jacob Levy of
Tarascon. The last known edition of the book, or rather
the greater part of it, was published only a few years ago
by Dr. Harkavy, of St. Petersburg, from a MS. in his
possession. Dr. Harkavy is also the owner of a hitherto
unpublished commentary thereon, composed in 1508 by
Isaac Mançon of Reggio. In some prefatory lines the author
states that he was induced to write the commentary, because
he had noticed that many young men in his country were
in the habit of learning the original by heart, without
knowing anything about its contents.
</p>

<p>
As regards the style and composition of the <i>Bechînath
Olam</i>, which seems to have been composed by Yedaya after
the expulsion of the Jews from France in 1306, it must be
admitted at the outset that the general reader will not find
them quite in harmony with modern taste. De Lacy, in
his <i>Magasin encyclopédique</i>, III, p. 321, censures the
author for his use of certain Biblical phrases in a sense
different to that which they bear in the Bible. But he
readily admits that the Church fathers during the Middle
Ages, and certain Arabic writers, at all times, have taken
the same liberties with the Scriptures and the Koran
respectively. The greatest of the Spanish-Jewish poets,
<span class="pageno target" title="74" id="page-74"></span>
not excluding Ibn Gabirol himself, allowed themselves the
same licence, while Charizi often made his happiest points
by the witty misuse of a familiar Biblical phrase. Despite
this defect, it cannot be denied that the <i>Bechînath Olam</i>
possesses a peculiar charm of its own.
</p>

<p>
Those who are acquainted with the Hebrew Bible, the
Midrash, and the Talmud, cannot fail to appreciate the art
with which Biblical phrases, used with an occasional striking
play on words, are worked into a mosaic. Take, for instance,
the following sentences which occur in chapter IX:—
</p>

<p class="dirrtl">
<span class="heb" title="efes chi lo tihie tipheret amemunot nimshechet--'od me'at vaits'e ruach Elohim livzor rechushecha--vayehi kelo hayu chamishim alphey zahav asher bakninim macharta naphshecha. tithaphech hazman kim'at rega' laqahat chen vechavod me'al roshecha--tered esh haElohim min hashamayim veteachel otcha veet chamishecha"
xml:lang="he">אפס כי לא תהיה תפארת הממנות נמשכת—עוד מעט ויצאה רוח
אלהים לבזור רכושיך—ויהיו כלא היו חמשים אלפי זהב אשר בקנינם
מכרת נפשך• תתהפך הזמן כמעט רגע לקחת חן וכבוד מעל ראשך—תרד
אש האלהים מן השמים ותאכל אותך ואת חמשיך•</span>
</p>

<p>
“By no means let thy pride in thy wealth endure, for at
any moment a blast may come from God, which will scatter
and disperse all thy treasures. Then will vanish as naught
the fifty thousand ducats for which thou hast bartered thy
soul, and thy former honour and glory will likewise depart
at thy sudden reverse of fortune. Or a fire may come down
from heaven, and devour thee along with thy five myriads
of ducats.”
</p>

<p>
Here it will at once be seen how cleverly the author uses
for his own purpose certain phrases found in the second
chapter of 2 Kings in connexion with the prophet Elijah,
and how ingenious the play on the word
<span class="heb" title="chamishecha" xml:lang="he">חמשיך</span> is.
</p>

<p>
As this peculiar mode of composition is a marked feature
of the <i>Bechînath Olam</i>, a few more examples of a somewhat
different kind may be given here for the sake of illustration.
In chapter IV we read as follows<a id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor"><sup>[74-1]</sup></a>:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Thy belongings in sooth are but passion and lust,</p>
    <p class="verse">Thy strength sinks asunder like light crumbling dust;</p>
<span class="pageno target" title="75" id="page-75"></span>
    <p class="verse">Thy treasures, like thorns, are surrounded with stings,</p>
    <p class="verse">Thy most precious possessions are but worthless things,</p>
    <p class="verse">Thy pride is enkindled like flames in the night,</p>
    <p class="verse">Thy riches, like insects, soon hasten to flight.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
And again, in chapter XI, the author gives the following
description of the four seasons of the year:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">The lovely Spring gives me no peace,</p>
    <p class="verse">For constant cares disturb my ease.</p>
    <p class="verse">The Summer, too, is full of pain,</p>
    <p class="verse">Its glow and heat are but my bane.</p>
    <p class="verse">The Autumn has no charms for me,</p>
    <p class="verse">From cold and ills I ne'er am free.</p>
    <p class="verse">When Winter brings its snow and frost,</p>
    <p class="verse">Oh, then I am undone and lost<a id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor"><sup>[75-1]</sup></a>.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
Another conspicuous feature of the <i>Bechînath Olam</i> is
its frequent use of poetical metaphors, which the author
employs with great aptitude and force. The eighth chapter
of the book in question, beginning with the words:
<span class="heb" title="hatevel yam zo'ef" xml:lang="he">התבל ים זועף</span>
may fitly serve as an illustration of this, and the
following free English translation of it will afford the reader
at the same time an insight into the general contents of the
whole poem. It runs as follows:—
</p>

<p>
“The world is as a boisterous sea of immense depth and
width, and time forms a fragile bridge built over it. The
upper end thereof is fastened to the ground by means of
weak ropes, and its lower end leads to a place which is
shone upon by the rays of the divine light, emanating from
God's majesty. The breadth of the bridge is but one short
span, and has no balustrade work to save one from falling
over it. Over this narrow path, thou, O son of man, art
compelled to go, and notwithstanding all thy might and
glory, thou canst not turn either to the right or to the
left. Now, threatened as thou art on both sides with death
<span class="pageno target" title="76" id="page-76"></span>
and destruction, how canst thou maintain thy courage, and
how can thy hands remain firm? In vain dost thou pride
thyself on the possession of vast treasures obtained by thee
through violence and wickedness; for of what avail are
they to thee when the sea rises, and rages, and foams, thus
threatening to wreck the little hut (i.e. the body) wherein
thou livest? Canst thou boast thou canst calm and subdue
the powerful waves, or wilt thou try to fight against them?
Drunk with the wine of thy vanity, thou art pushed hither
and thither, until thou sinkest into the mighty abyss; and
tossed about from deep to deep, thou wilt at last be merged
in the foaming waves, and none will bring thee to life
again.”
</p>

<p>
The ninth and eleventh chapters of the <i>Bechînath Olam</i>
contain some passages which refer to the author's own
sufferings, at the time of the expulsion of the Jews from
France, and to the cowardice then displayed by some
wealthy French Jews, who, in order to be permitted to
remain in the country, and to retain their riches, had
embraced Christianity. How shamefully these renegades
behaved, in the face of the great calamity which had befallen
their co-religionists, may be seen from the following
passages, which occur in chapter XI:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">What care they for those gloomy envoys of fate?</p>
    <p class="verse">They dance all the night, and they rise very late.</p>
    <p class="verse">Feasting they love, and high play and flirtation,</p>
    <p class="verse">And laughter, and pleasure, and wild dissipation.</p>
    <p class="verse">They look upon evil, of whatever sort,</p>
    <p class="verse">As a mirth-causing jest, and an innocent sport<a id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor"><sup>[76-1]</sup></a>.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
The chief fault of the book is the frequent use of Chaldaic
and Aramaic words and phrases, a proper translation of
which is almost impossible, but these are more than counterbalanced
by its many merits.
</p>

<p>
Another small treatise, composed by the same author
<span class="pageno target" title="77" id="page-77"></span>
when he was eighteen years old, is one that bears the title
<span class="heb" title="tsiltsul knafayim" xml:lang="he">צלצול כנפים</span>,
and has for its subject
“The Defence of Women.”
Till about fifteen years ago there was one MS. in existence—that
in the Bodleian Library; but Dr. Neubauer published
it for the first time in the <i>Jubelschrift</i> (Berlin, 1888), issued
by some friends of Zunz on the occasion of his celebrating
his ninetieth birthday, under the title of
<span class="heb" title="ohev nashim" xml:lang="he">אוהב נשים</span>, “The
Women's Friend” This title is more appropriate than the
one it originally bore, for the simple reason that the treatise
in question was evidently written by Yedaya in opposition
to another, composed in 1208, by the physician Judah ben
Sabbatai, under the title of
<span class="heb" title="sone' nashim" xml:lang="he">שונא נשים</span>,
“The Woman-hater.”
This treatise, which Yedaya dedicated to two of his friends,
viz. to Meïr and Judah, the sons of Don Solomon Del
Infanz, is written in rhymed prose, intermixed with a few
short verses. Its style is rather heavy, and all that can be
gathered from its subject-matter is this, that a certain king,
called Cushan Rishataïm, a great woman-hater, once waged
war against an army composed of the friends of womankind,
and led by a general named Seria. The latter ultimately
defeated the king and his hostile troops, and, out of
gratitude for his great victory, he was himself proclaimed
king by his own followers. Under his reign a new and
happy era opened for the women, who are then wooed and
married, and loved more dearly than before; and wedded
life is everywhere declared to be the most desirable state
of existence.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="heb" title="ohev nashim" xml:lang="he">אוהב נשים</span>
closes with
the description of the appearance
of Judah ben Sabbatai's ghost on earth, and of how it agrees
with all Yedaya's statements made there, with the exception
of one. Every man, the ghost declares, ought certainly
to marry once; but it would be the height of folly on his
part if he were to enter again upon the matrimonial state,
after his first marriage had turned out a failure.
</p>

<p>
In passing, it may be mentioned that the same controversy
about the merits and demerits of the married state was still
carried on in the sixteenth century among some learned
<span class="pageno target" title="78" id="page-78"></span>
Jewish writers in Italy. Among these are most conspicious:
<a id="poem"></a>Jacob of Fano, who in his poem
<span class="heb" title="shiltey hagibborim" xml:lang="he">שלטי הגבורים</span>,
“The Shield
of the Mighty,” makes a strong attack on women, and
Judah Sommo, of Portaleone, who in his treatise
<span class="heb" title="magen nashim" xml:lang="he">מגן נשים</span>,
“The Women's Protector,” which exists in a MS. in the
Bodleian Library, presents himself as a champion of women.
To these writers may be added Messer Leon (flourished at
Mantua, at the end of the fifteenth century) who, in a commentary
on the thirty-first chapter of Proverbs, eulogizes the
female sex in general, and a few specially named women in
particular. Among them he mentions Laura, the lady-love
of the poet Petrarch; and it is interesting to notice the
trouble which the author takes to prove that Laura was by
no means a myth, as some writers on Petrarch consider
her, but that she really existed in person, and was remarkable
for her exquisite beauty and grace.
</p>

<p>
Resuming now our review of Yedaya's literary compositions,
especially of those he wrote when he was still very
young, we have to refer to a Hebrew hymn of his, well
known under the title of
<span class="heb" title="baqashat hamemin" xml:lang="he">בקשת הממין</span>,
the formal characteristic
of which is this, that each word of it begins with the letter
<i>Mem</i> (מ). Bartolocci, in his <i>Bibliotheca Rabbinica</i>, III, p. 7,
gives the same hymn the title of
<span class="heb" title="tehilla leshem" xml:lang="he">תהלה לשם</span>,
“Praise of God.”
This seems to have been Yedaya's first literary attempt, it
being generally assumed that it was composed by him at the
age of fourteen. His father, Abraham, himself a writer of
Hebrew verses of inferior quality, was so delighted with
his son's hymn that he sang its praises in a short Hebrew
quatrain. Although, from a literary point of view, the
<i>Supplication of the Memmin</i> has little to recommend it,
it has passed through fifteen editions, and has frequently
been translated into German, and once also into Latin
by Hil. Prache, who published his version at Leipzig,
in 1662.
</p>

<p>
Another short composition belonging to an early period
of Yedaya's life is his
<span class="heb" title="sefer hapardes" xml:lang="he">ספר הפרדס</span>,
“The Book on Paradise,”
which was composed by him at the age of seventeen, and
<span class="pageno target" title="79" id="page-79"></span>
appeared for the first time in print at Constantinople, in
1517. It is divided into four chapters, each of which has
a different heading, while the fourth chapter is again subdivided
into four sections. The principal subjects discussed
in these chapters are (<i>a</i>) The worship of God; (<i>b</i>) Friendship
and Enmity; (<i>c</i>) The Lack of Stability in the World; and
(<i>d</i>) The Desirability of Studying Science after the usual
Devotions. After having reached manhood, he wrote
several other treatises of a similar description, each of
which will be briefly noticed here.
</p>

<p>
(1) <span class="heb" title="lashon hazahav" xml:lang="he">לשון הזהב</span>,
“The Golden Tongue.” This forms part
of a commentary (existing as a MS. on the <i>Agada</i> and the
<i>Midrashim</i>), and was first printed at Venice in 1599.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p79l14"></a>(2) A MS. bearing the inscription
<span class="heb" title="pirush masechet avoth upirush aggadoth baTalmud"
xml:lang="he">פירוש מסכת אבות ופירוש אגדות בתלמוד</span>,
Commentary on the Ethics of the Fathers,
and on the Agadoth in the Talmud.
</p>

<p>
(3) <span class="heb" title="iggeret hitnatslut" xml:lang="he">אגרת התנצלות</span>,
An apologetical Letter. This well-known
and often-quoted letter was addressed by Yedaya to
Rabbi Solomon ben Adereth (<span class="heb" title="rash''ba" xml:lang="he">רש״בא</span>), on the occasion of his
publicly censuring the Jewish communities of the Provence
for their occupying themselves with scientific studies.
There a passage occurs which throws some light on the
author's own ideas thereon. It was as follows:—
</p>

<p>
“We cannot give up science; it is as the breath of our
nostrils. Even if Joshua were to appear and forbid it we
would not obey him; for we have a warranty which outweighs
them all, viz. Maimuni, who recommended it, and
impressed it upon us. We are ready to set our goods, our
children, and our lives at stake for it<a id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor"><sup>[79-1]</sup></a>.”
</p>

<p>
(4) A Liturgical Poem. It is composed of a number of
words, each of which begins with the letter <i>Aleph</i>
(<span class="heb" title="aleph" xml:lang="he">א</span>), and
refers, according to Graetz<a id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor"><sup>[79-2]</sup></a>, to the sufferings endured by
the French Jews in 1306.
</p>

<p>
(5) A Treatise on Medicine, based on a similar work
composed by the Jewish philosopher Ibn Sina.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="80" id="page-80"></span>
</div>

<p>
(6) <span class="heb" title="ktav hadat" xml:lang="he">כתב הדת</span>,
“A Treatise on Intellect.” This, too, is based
on another book treating of a kindred subject, and bearing
the inscription
<span class="heb" title="sefer hasechel vehamuschalut" xml:lang="he">ספר השכל והמושכלות</span>,
the author of which is
Al-Fabri. A Latin translation of the latter exists under
the title of <i>De Intellectu et Intellecto</i>, Venice, 1595.
</p>

<p>
(7) <span class="heb" title="hada'at besechel achomri" xml:lang="he">הדעת בשכל החמרי</span>, “Opinions on
the Material Intellect.”
</p>

<p>
(8) <span class="heb" title="hamaamar behephkhey hamahalach" xml:lang="he">המאמר בהפכי המהלך</span>
is a philosophical treatise on the
movements of bodies, and has been quoted by Ibn Habib
under the title of
<span class="heb" title="ktav hephkhey haanach" xml:lang="he">כתב הפכי האנח</span>.
</p>

<p>
(9)
 <span class="heb" title="ktav hahit'atsmuth" xml:lang="he">כתב ההתעצמות</span>,
“Treatise on Consolation.”
</p>

<p>
(10) Is a MS. without any title; but judging from its
contents, it seems to correspond with the
<span class="heb" title="sefer hatsuroth haminioth" xml:lang="he">ספר הצורות המיניות</span>
once quoted by the same Ibn Habib.
</p>

<p>
(11) <span class="heb" title="midbar qedemoth" xml:lang="he">מדבר קדמות</span>,
“The Desert of Kedemoth.” This is
a commentary on the twenty-five propositions placed by
Maimonides at the beginning of the tenth chapter of his
<span class="heb" title="moreh nevokhim" xml:lang="he">מורה נבוכים</span>.
</p>

<p>
(12) A Hebrew poem, having for its subject the thirteen
articles as arranged by Maimonides.
</p>

<p>
The authorship of the following four compositions is also
attributed to Yedaya:—
</p>

<p>
(1) A Divan, compiled by a member of the family of
Bedaresi, that member being, according to Luzzatto, no
other than our Yedaya.
</p>

<p>
(2) <span class="heb" title="ma'adaney melech" xml:lang="he">מעדני מלך</span>,
“The Pleasure of a King,” is a short
treatise on the game of Chess, and has several times
appeared in print.
</p>

<p>
(3) Wolf, in the <i>Bibliotheca Rabbinica</i>, I, p. 403, attributes
to Yedaya the authorship of a commentary on another
commentary, written by Abraham Ibn Ezra on the Book
of Genesis, the former of which exists as a MS. in the Paris
National Library.
</p>

<p>
(4) <span class="heb" title="iggeret hateshuvah" xml:lang="he">אגרת התשובה</span>,
“A Letter of Response,” This letter,
which was published by Dr. Berliner in 1888, and copies
of which are found in various MSS., is attributed to Yedaya
by Bartolocci and de Rossi.
</p>

<p>
Enough has been said to show the industry, which was
<span class="pageno target" title="81" id="page-81"></span>
Yedaya's most striking characteristic. At a time when
a man's mind is perturbed by external influences, involving
not only his abilities but even his personal safety, it would
seem that intellectual work would be impossible: it was,
however, at such a time that the bulk of Yedaya's work
was undertaken and executed.

<p class="subtitle2">
A THIRTEENTH-CENTURY HEBREW HUMORIST
AND A FRIEND OF DANTE</p>

<p>
<span class="begc">In</span> the present essay a short sketch will be given of
the life and works of Immanuel di Roma, the Heine of
the Middle Ages, as Graetz terms him, commonly called
Immanuel ben Shelomoh; and reference will also be made
to his literary and friendly relationship to the poet Dante
Alighieri. It ought, however, to be stated at the outset
that, although Immanuel was the composer of several
Italian sonnets, he owes his fame mainly to his Hebrew
production entitled <i>Machberoth</i>. Apart from its value as
an entertaining book it is at the same time the chief
source from which information about its author's life is
obtainable. But as such the volume is not always entirely
reliable, as certain episodes mentioned therein have hitherto
not been fully authenticated. Modern writers, however,
among whom Graetz and Güdemann may be especially
mentioned, have ably utilized the old and new material
available, and, thanks to their fruitful labours, a more
complete and trustworthy sketch of Immanuel's life and
works can now be given. According to Graetz's ingenious
combination of dates and circumstances (cp. <i>Die
Geschichte der Juden</i>, VII, note 3), it would seem that
Immanuel was born in the year 1265, which is also the
year of Dante's birth. Immanuel's parents, Solomon and
Justa by name, belonged to a renowned Jewish family
called Ziphroni, and occupied an honourable position in
the Jewish community of Rome. They devoted great care
to their son's early education. One of his earliest teachers
was Benjamin ben Yechiel, a clever physician and a great
Hebrew scholar, who made him acquainted with the works
of Maimonides. Later on he was taught by a relative,
<span class="pageno target" title="83" id="page-83"></span>
Leone Romano by name, who held the post of Hebrew
instructor to Robert, king of Naples, and was also the
translator of the works of Albertus Magnus and of Thomas
Aquinas. He had another master in Judah Siciliano,
author of several pretty Italian poems, who cultivated in
his pupil's mind a taste for poetry and literature. Through
these teachers, who mingled with the best society of Rome,
Immanuel often came in contact with the members of a
secret literary and political society called “Young Italy.”
It was composed of young men of education and talent,
and its object was to propagate liberal ideas among their
less enlightened countrymen, and to induce them to shake
off the yoke of the dominant Church, which at that time
pressed heavily upon them. Dante, during his brief stay
in Rome, used to attend the meetings of this society; and
there young Immanuel seems to have first entered on
a friendly relationship with the poet, whose genius and
personality could not fail to impress themselves on him. In
fact, he has so many points in common with Dante, that
it may well be believed that he took him for his model.
There is also a curious similarity in the history of their
life and death. Both of them, who had in the prime of
life occupied prominent positions, were obliged in their
declining years to wander forth into exile, and both found
their last resting-place far from their native city. From
the literary point of view they, too, resembled one another;
but of this more will be said later on. Reference will also
be made to some recent publications which seem to show
that Dante, for his part, also entertained friendly feelings
for Immanuel. The following two lines, which occur in
<i>Paradiso</i> (Canto v. 80 and 81), show that their author may
have been favourably disposed to the race from which
Immanuel sprang. They run thus:—
</p>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="84" id="page-84"></span>
</div>

<p>
It is not known whether Immanuel underwent any
special training to obtain his medical qualifications. There
is, however, no doubt that he practised successfully for
a number of years in his native town. On reaching manhood
he married the daughter of Rabbi Samuel, president
of the Jewish community of Rome, whose functions seem
to have been secular as well as religious.
</p>

<p>
His marriage was a happy one. Immanuel considered
his wife a model of womanhood, and never wearied of
singing her praises. With the exception of the untimely
death of their only son Moses, which naturally caused
them intense sorrow, nothing occurred during the greater
part of their married life that could have seriously interfered
with their happiness. In his leisure hours Immanuel
continued to enlarge his acquaintance with books treating
of grammar, exegesis, mathematics, astronomy, medicine,
philosophy, and cabbala, and acquired at the same
time some knowledge of Latin, Greek, and Arabic. He
occasionally wrote essays on some of these subjects, but
his favourite occupation was the composition of verses,
either in his native tongue or in Hebrew. The rhymed
prose (<span class="heb" title="melitsah" xml:lang="he">מליצה</span>), which he wrote in Hebrew, was his best work.
In the year 1315, when Immanuel was just fifty years old,
his father-in-law was murdered by robbers whilst travelling
in the country, and Immanuel succeeded him. In his new
position, as the spiritual head of the Jewish community of
Rome, he enjoyed a continuance of his popularity, his kindness
of heart and his great literary attainments procuring for
him a large following of admirers and friends. His fame as a
scholar and a poet spread even as far as France and Spain.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of his prosperity, however, a misfortune
occurred, which changed the whole tenor of his life.
According to Immanuel's own account, he had stood security
for some friends of his, and, as the latter failed to
redeem their obligations, he himself was obliged to satisfy
the demands of the creditors. Being thus reduced to
poverty he emigrated, and turned his back for ever on the
<span class="pageno target" title="85" id="page-85"></span>
scene of his unmerited misfortune. This explanation, however
plausible it may appear, does not throw any light on
the mystery of Immanuel's forced resignation of the post
he held in the community. But it would seem that there
were among his flock several persons who hated him as
the author of erotic poems, and of other compositions in
which certain religious rites were lightly spoken of. While
he had ample means at his disposal, and was independent
of the community, they dared not attack him publicly.
However, they took advantage of his monetary embarrassment
to denounce him as an unbeliever and heretic, who
in their opinion was unfit to occupy his position; and they
ultimately succeeded in effecting his removal.
</p>

<p>
But, whatever the explanation, the fact remains that
Immanuel left Rome as a prematurely aged and broken-hearted
man, and that he wandered about for some time
with his wife until he arrived at Fermo, a town situated in
the district of Ancona. There a wealthy and liberal-minded
man, Benjamin by name, and at the same time a
great admirer of Immanuel's poems, took him and his wife
into his house, and provided for their wants. But this
happiness did not last long, for in the year 1321 he lost
both his wife and his friend Dante. Bosone da Gobbio,
a renowned lawyer in his time, and a friend of both Dante
and Immanuel, on hearing of this sent him the following
lines as a token of his sorrow and sympathy:—
</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
<p class="poetry-title">Bosone to the Jew Manuello after Dante's Death.</p>
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Two lamps of life have waxèd dim and died,</p>

    <p class="verse">Then Jew and Gentile weep, and sit with me</p>

    <p class="verse">I prayed to God to spare this misery,</p>
    <p class="verse">And now no more my trust in Him I show.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
When Immanuel's time of mourning was over his host
suggested that he should devote himself to a collection and
revision of his compositions. Immanuel gladly accepted
this proposal, partly because he wished to perpetuate the
memory of his beloved wife and that of his friend Dante,
and partly because he thought that this would be the best
occupation for his declining years.
</p>

<p>
The work occupied him till his death in 1330, when he
was sixty-five years old. Bosone received some lines referring
to Immanuel's death, composed by Cino da Pistoza, a
noted lawyer and poet of some renown in his time. These
lines are interesting in so far as they contain an unmistakable
reference to the friendly relationship that existed
between Dante and Immanuel. They run as follows:—
</p>

<p>
As already stated Immanuel wrote various books on
Hebrew grammar, exegesis, and cabbala, and composed,
in addition to several Biblical commentaries, a collection
of Hebrew novelettes and poems. But while his <i>Eben
Bochan</i> and <i>Migdal Oz</i>—which exist only in MSS. and
treat of Hebrew grammar and cabbala respectively—would,
at the present day, hardly be considered to have
any literary or scientific value, his commentaries on the
Bible, and more especially those on the Book of Proverbs
(published at Naples in 1487), deserve some attention. The
latter is particularly interesting, inasmuch as it throws
some light on the author's views on the study of secular
subjects by his Italian co-religionists, and gives us some
idea of the general feeling and spirit of the time. The
following example will give an idea of Immanuel's method
when commenting on a passage that seemed to him to offer
an opportunity for adding a thought of his own. Thus, in the
commentary on the Book of Proverbs (xxvi. 13), Immanuel
explains the passage, “The slothful (man) saith, There is a
lion in the way; a lion in the street,” as follows:—
</p>

<p>
“This passage refers specially to those persons who are
too slow in the acquirement of knowledge and wisdom,
which they consider as dangerous as it is to meet a fierce
lion in the street. They say, How should we apply ourselves
to the study of general science, since among its most
prominent devotees there are so many sceptics and unbelievers;
or how should we be expected to study logic, as
<span class="pageno target" title="88" id="page-88"></span>
it is a subject that infatuates the student and leads him to
erroneous conclusions? As to philosophy (they say) we
must shun it altogether, since it owes its existence to
Aristotle, who, like the rest of the ancient philosophers,
did not believe in the divine origin of our law. But these
fools (Immanuel continues) forget that we must accept
truth from whatever quarter it may come. Moreover,
every kind of science which these sluggards describe as
‘foreign’ (<span class="heb" title="chitsonim" xml:lang="he">חיצונים</span>),
belonged originally to the Jewish people,
and was first taught in our sacred tongue. Unfortunately
those very books were lost during our perilous wanderings
through the world. Of King Solomon's numerous poetical
and scientific works we only possess three. It is more
than a mere legend that kings and learned men of different
countries came to him with the express purpose of being
instructed by him in those subjects, and that they subsequently
committed to writing the information they
received. These teachings are still in the possession of
other nations, while we, ourselves, lost them during our
wanderings; and it is even a wonder that the twenty-four
volumes of Holy Writ have been preserved by us up to the
present day. It is, therefore, most probable that natural
science, metaphysics, and philosophy were originally taught
by Solomon, although their origin is nowadays ascribed to
Plato and Aristotle. With regard to the excellent art of
music it is well known that it originated in our religion,
and has found keen votaries in men like Asaph and
Samuel; but in our own time it is exclusively practised
by Christians, while the Jews have very little knowledge
of it. As for logic, it certainly does <i>not</i> lead the student
astray, but, on the contrary, it cultivates his mind and
prepares him for the study of other sciences. Therefore,
whoever calls logic a ‘foreign’ science, or speaks contemptuously
of Plato and Aristotle, because they did not
belong to the Jewish nation, is like the sluggard who
exclaims: ‘A lion is in the way.’”
</p>

<p>
This extract, being a specimen of the contents of
<span class="pageno target" title="89" id="page-89"></span>
Immanuel's commentaries on various parts of the Bible,
shows that there is nothing particularly noteworthy in the
author's exposition of the text, but that the interest lies
rather in his interpolations.
</p>

<p>
His reputation chiefly depends on his collection of Hebrew
novelettes and poems, called <i>Machberoth</i>. This volume
stands unrivalled in the whole domain of Hebrew literature.
It consists of twenty-eight chapters, in almost all of
which the so-called Makāmāt form is used, that is to say,
they are written in rhymed prose, interspersed with poems.
Some of these are composed in the melodious form introduced
by the Italian poet Fra Guittone di Arezzo (about
1259), the principal characteristics of which are <i>rima chiusa</i>
and <i>rima alternata</i>. But, although his poetry is full of
charm for style and expression, it must yield to his rhymed
prose. The principal feature of this kind of composition
lies in the application of short Biblical phrases to profane
objects or actions. It was first used by certain Arabian
poets, who treated the text of the Koran after this fashion,
and who subsequently found several imitators among
Hebrew writers, especially among those belonging to the
so-called Spanish school. In fact, according to Rabbi
Moses ben Chabib (about 1486), the writing of rhymed
prose in Hebrew was in his time a universally approved
rhetorical device. But there was a vast difference between
Immanuel and the other writers of this school. While the
latter, as a rule, endeavoured to preserve a spirit of
reverence towards the Hebrew text, Immanuel placed no
restraint upon his pen. Not seldom he sacrificed good
taste and decency to his point, and many a simple Biblical
phrase he turns into a vehicle for a pun or satirical remark
of a coarse description. His favourite subjects were Love,
Wine, and Song, and he was not less fond of occasionally
making mock of sacred things. Even the sight of an
old churchyard with a heap of ruined tombstones could
not check his buffoonery. It seems to have become a
second nature with him, so much so that having once
<span class="pageno target" title="90" id="page-90"></span>
begun to scoff at the follies of other people, he does not
hesitate to make merry over his own vanities, and it is in
this sense that the strange expressions of self-approbation,
which are found here and there in the <i>Machberoth</i>, must be
construed. That Immanuel's self-praise should be regarded
as serious seems scarcely compatible with the frequent
eulogies of others with which his book abounds.
</p>

<p>
It would be at once vain and superfluous to offer an
apology for the frivolities and the uncouth wit which
characterize the <i>Machberoth</i>. Immanuel, although a Hebrew
by descent and training, and eminently proficient in Jewish
lore and tradition, was at the same time thoroughly imbued
with the spirit of the Italian nation and literature. The
character of his writings will be recognized from the fact
that the principal representative of the Italian novelists
belonging to the period was Boccaccio, the author of that
collection of humorous but licentious tales, the <i>Decameron</i>.
It seems reasonable to suppose that Immanuel, in adopting
the style of the Italian novelists of his time, thought he
would attract and amuse Jewish readers by reproducing
in a Hebrew garb popular ideas and expressions. In this
he attained considerable success, though he was placed at
a disadvantage as compared with his Italian rivals. For,
while they had the whole world for their field, Immanuel
had to content himself with using as the objects of his
satire persons and things known only to the small circle
of his own acquaintances. Thus he mostly ridiculed the
vanities and follies of his Jewish neighbours, the petty
quarrels of husband and wife, or the jealousies of the
would-be literary man. But, notwithstanding their defects,
the <i>Machberoth</i> possess a lasting charm. They have always
found a great number of readers, although they were condemned
by Moses di Rieti (died about 1500), the author
of a short history of Hebrew literature called <i>Mikdash
Me'at</i> (<span class="heb" title="Mikdash Me'at" xml:lang="he">מקדש מעט</span>),
and their perusal was interdicted a century
later by Joseph Caro, the compiler of the well-known code,
the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>. The best proof of their popularity
<span class="pageno target" title="91" id="page-91"></span>
lies in the fact that they have gone through several editions,
the first being produced at Brescia, in the year 1492, and
the last at Lemberg in 1870. In recent years parts of
them have been translated into German by Steinschneider,
Stern, Geiger, Fürst, and others.
</p>

<p>
As regards the title of the book and the arrangement of
its parts, the following remarks are offered. The word
<i>Machberoth</i>, or, as some people would read it <i>Mechabroth</i>, is
the plural of the singular noun <i>machbereth</i>, formed of the
radix <span class="heb" title="chaber" xml:lang="he">חַבֵּר</span>,
which originally means “to join” or “to put
together,” so that in the present sense the noun signifies
“collections.” Immanuel purposely used the plural form
as the title of his book to prevent it from being confounded
with a similar work composed by Alcharizi, which is
entitled <i>Machbereth Ithiel</i>, where the same term appears in
the singular. Immanuel's work consists, as already stated
above, of twenty-eight chapters, which seem to have been
written at different times, and to have then been loosely
strung together. Only the second, third, and the last three
chapters of the book bear a superscription to indicate the
subject of which they treat. Several of these chapters were
composed by the author when he was still comparatively
young, and are distinguished by the same genial Epicureanism
which Horace displayed when he sang:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Quid sit futurum cras fuge quaerere, et</p>
    <p class="verse">Quem Fors dierum cunque dabit lucro</p>
    <p class="verse2">Appone.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
On the other hand, there is no doubt that the greater
part of the <i>Machberoth</i> must belong to a later period in
the author's life, when he had experienced the caprices of
fortune, and his troubles had disturbed the serenity of his
mind. But even then his laughter does not entirely desert
him. It ought, moreover, to be remembered that injustice
would be done to Immanuel, if his private life and character
were to be judged in the light of his writings. In these he
certainly appears as an absolute libertine, and as a scoffer
at religion and religious practices; but in real life he was
<span class="pageno target" title="92" id="page-92"></span>
very different. One would rather think that the <i>Machberoth</i>
were intended to serve as a mirror, in which the
culpable habits of a certain class of his Jewish contemporaries
were reflected. And it is for this reason that they
have more than a mere literary value. They furnish the
reader with a description of the moral and social condition
of an important section of the Italian Jews during part of
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and have been
referred to by our modern Jewish historians in this connexion<a id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor"><sup>[92-1]</sup></a>.
Thus, for instance, we gather from some passages
occurring in the <i>Machberoth</i> (chap. 1) that the Jewish
community of Rome was at that period in a flourishing
condition, that many of its members lived in large and
magnificently furnished houses, and that some of them
also possessed estates in the country. Further, we are told
(ibid. chap. 23) that general science, philosophy, and poetry
were assiduously studied and appreciated by the Jews of
Rome, and that those who attained great learning among
them were held in high estimation. How eager Jewish
young men in Italy were in those days to increase their
knowledge of books may be seen from the following incident
recorded in the <i>Machberoth</i> (chap. 8). A Jewish
bookseller, travelling from Spain to Rome, left at Perugia
one of his boxes containing various books, together with a
list of their titles. Immanuel and his young friends were so
anxious to read the contents that, in the absence of their
owner, they broke the box open, and read the books it contained
with the greatest delight. When on his return the
bookseller learnt what had happened, Immanuel appeased
his wrath by the witty remark, “that the Prophet Moses on
his once breaking the two tablets of the Covenant, not only
did not arouse God's anger, but was even praised for the act.”
</p>

<p>
Of the Jewish women of the time Immanuel does not
always draw a flattering picture. They, or rather those
belonging to the best and most educated families, mixed
<span class="pageno target" title="93" id="page-93"></span>
freely with men; but their desire for beautiful and costly
apparel led the girls to prefer the wealthy suitor to his
poorer, though perhaps more deserving, rival. A great many
Jewish ladies, however, were, according to him, modest and
simple in their taste; and if he satirizes the luxurious habits
of Jewish women, and their laxity in point of good manners,
it need not be supposed that they were in the majority.
</p>

<p>
To convey to English readers some idea of the contents
of the <i>Machberoth</i> a few extracts are here given, which
cannot of course be expected to present the charm of the
original, but are accurate in themselves.
</p>

<p>
After a short prologue, in which Immanuel speaks of the
tendency of the <i>Machberoth</i> and of the reason which induced
him to publish them, the author addresses his muse
in a passage, of which the following lines form a part:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Oh, let thy teachings softly flow like heaven's dew,</p>
    <p class="verse">That they inspire mankind with what is good and true;</p>
    <p class="verse">And let “Immanuel” a potent watchword be,</p>
    <p class="verse">Ever to make all men in soul and body free.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
The first chapter of the <i>Machberoth</i> was apparently
written at a late period of the author's life, when he was in
exile. He speaks bitterly of his open and secret enemies,
who were the direct cause of his ruin; but he consoles
himself with the thought that he is their superior in
culture, and that he had a wife and comforter, who excelled
their wives in virtue and beauty, and who might serve to
all women as a model for imitation. That virtue and
beauty do not always go hand in hand is a frequent
maxim of his:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Virtue dwells rarely in the bright-eyed and fair,</p>
    <p class="verse">But in wrinkled old crones with silver-white hair.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
The author is now in his proper element, and pretending
to stand with a friend of his on the public promenade,
where the ladies of the town are walking to and fro, he
singles out two of them. The one, called Tamar, he
describes as a model of perfect beauty; and the other,
Beriah by name, he designates as the personification of
<span class="pageno target" title="94" id="page-94"></span>
ugliness. The merits of the one, and the demerits of the
other, are described by Immanuel in the following manner:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Tamar looketh up, like the stars shine her eyes,</p>
    <p class="verse">Beriah appears, and Satan's self flies.</p>
    <p class="verse">Tamar's form divine excites angels' desire,</p>
    <p class="verse">Beriah e'en crows with dismay might inspire.</p>
    <p class="verse">Tamar, like the sun, makes all things bright appear,</p>
    <p class="verse">Beriah were an omen, if seen at New Year.</p>
    <p class="verse">Tamar is most lovely and fair to distraction,</p>
    <p class="verse">Beriah gives mankind of love not a fraction.</p>
    <p class="verse">Tamar, bright as the moon, is yet e'er full of light,</p>
    <p class="verse">Beriah might be queen 'mongst the fiends of the night.</p>
    <p class="verse">Tamar, would I were a flower, tender and sweet,</p>
    <p class="verse">To be trampled to earth by her pretty feet.</p>
    <p class="verse">Beriah 'tis from fear of beholding her face</p>
    <p class="verse">That Messiah delayeth in showing his grace.</p>
    <p class="verse">Tamar is enchanting, delighting the eyes,</p>
    <p class="verse">Beriah a nightmare in woman's disguise.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
Some beautiful lyrics devoted to the same subject are to
be found in the sixteenth chapter of the <i>Machberoth</i>, two

“Paradise and Hell,” run as follows:—

<p>
There are several novelettes in the <i>Machberoth</i> dealing
with various piquant incidents, but the two following are
perhaps most suitable for quotation. In themselves they
are slight enough, but they become a ready vehicle for the
author's satire. In one of them (chap. 14) a clever trick is described;
how a certain legacy hunter succeeded in obtaining
a large gift from some trustees. A wealthy Jew living in
Rome had a quarrelsome woman for a wife and a spendthrift
and a fool for a son, both of whom embittered his life. One
day, the wretched man fled from his native town with all
his movables, and settled in Greece, where he lived for
a number of years in peace and contentment. Shortly
before his death he made his will, leaving all his property
to his prodigal son. As executors of his will he nominated
some elders of the local community. When in due course
the father died, and the intelligence of his death and testament
was made known in Rome, the son took no steps to
have the will executed. Meanwhile a certain swindler,
hearing of this, presented himself before the executors with
every sign of grief, and claimed the legacy as the son and
heir of the deceased. The executors, without troubling
themselves very much about his credentials, handed over
the legacy to him. When some time after the rightful heir
appeared, he was laughed to shame, in spite of his producing
genuine credentials.
</p>

<p>
In the second novelette (chap. 23) an incident is recorded
that occurred to the author in his practice as a
physician. He was once called in to a patient, who was
suffering from indigestion. Immanuel prescribed some
<span class="pageno target" title="96" id="page-96"></span>
medicine, and advised him to remain in bed till the
following morning, when he hoped to see him again, and to
find him completely recovered. Now, the patient was by
way of being a poet, and on that particular night, feeling
himself inspired, he got out of bed and composed a long
poem. This he proudly showed Immanuel on the following
morning, telling him at the same time that the medicine
had done him no good. “Pardon me, my friend,” said
Immanuel, “my medicine has had an excellent effect upon
you: it has removed from your brain a large quantity of
rubbishing poetry.”
</p>

<p>
Wit of another kind is shown in Immanuel's exegetical
dialogue (chap. 11), in which he explains some Biblical
passages and phrases that had been misunderstood by
various persons, who had come to ask him for his opinion.
The following will serve as a specimen of the whole.
</p>

<p>
A man, who apparently considered himself an expert in
Biblical lore, asked the author quite seriously how it was
that, having always been told that the “law” had been
given on Mount Sinai, in another passage, occurring in the
Book of Esther (iii. 15), it is expressly stated that “the law
was given in Shushan,” thus mistaking the Mosaic law for
that promulgated by King Ahasuerus (for the destruction
of all his Jewish subjects). But Immanuel was equal to
the occasion, and in an equally serious manner said: “You are
quite right, my friend, but you seem to have misunderstood
the meaning of the word “Shushan.” The latter does not
refer to the <i>place</i>, but to the <i>time</i> in which the law was
given. This was in the Shushan-season
(<span class="heb" title="shushan" xml:lang="he">שושן</span>=“rose”), when
the rose is in its full bloom, which is, as everybody knows,
in spring time.”
</p>

<p>
On another occasion Immanuel treats satirically of the
theme which Horace dealt with in his first satire,
beginning:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Qui fit, Maecenas, ut nemo quam sibi sortem, &amp;c.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
The author represents a number of persons, each of
whom is dissatisfied with his position. They learn, however,
<span class="pageno target" title="97" id="page-97"></span>
that those very persons who had been the objects of
their envy, themselves suffered from various unimagined
evils, and accordingly declare on oath that they would
never consent to change from what they actually are.
</p>

<p>
Immanuel does not, however, restrict himself to humorous
subjects. He shows himself possessed of tender sensibility,
which finds expression in several pathetic passages. The
sight of tombstones and graves, the death of a near relative
or friend, or any kindred event, at once brings with it
serious reflections. He then addresses himself to God in
fervent prayer, and pours out his innermost soul in strains
that are full of warmth and feeling, and impress the mind
by their earnestness and devotion. There are nineteen
prayers and hymns to be found in the <i>Machberoth</i>, most of
which bear the stamp of the author's religious sentiments;
the one that occurs in chapter 26, beginning with the words
<span class="heb" title="Elohim naflu panai bezichri vechule" xml:lang="he">אלהים נפלו פני בזכרי וכ׳</span>,
has been inserted in the so-called
Roman <i>Machsor</i> (published in the year 1436), which proves
its effectiveness as a liturgical poem, and shows at the same
time that even a century after the author's death his name
was honourably remembered by the Jews of Italy.
</p>

<p>
To this class of poetry may be added a lengthy epitaph
(chap. 21), composed by Immanuel as a kind of “In
Memoriam” of himself. In the same chapter is also to be
found a funeral oration in rhymed prose, which the author
set down as an exemplar of the one he expected would be
delivered at his bier after his death. But, even when
discussing so serious a topic as death and burial, Immanuel
cannot abstain from making jokes on himself and his
supposed mourners. Why, he asks mockingly, should he
himself fare better than Noah and Solomon, who had to
leave behind them, the one a splendid vineyard, and the
other a number of beautiful wives? Those who mourn for
him, will, he thinks, no doubt forget how to laugh after he
is no more, but he expects that they will regain their spirits
when they read his posthumous work.
</p>

<p>
The last, and in some respects, perhaps, the most interesting
<span class="pageno target" title="98" id="page-98"></span>
chapter in the <i>Machberoth</i>, is the one entitled <i>Ha-Topheth-ve-Ha-Eden</i>,
or “Hell and Paradise.” If, after all that has
been said, there is still any doubt about the friendship
between Dante and Immanuel, this chapter, as well as the
circumstances in which it was written, will effectively
dispel it. According to recent investigations (cp. Ersch
and Gruber's <i>Real-Encyklopädie</i>, <i>sub</i> “Dante”), it would
seem that Dante's <i>Inferno</i> and <i>Purgatorio</i> were not
published before the years 1314 and 1318 respectively,
because certain incidents and events that happened during
those years are mentioned therein. At that time Immanuel
was about fifty years old, and had just begun his wanderings
in a state of destitution. Now, considering that in those
times, before the invention of printing, a written copy of
any important work could only be procured by wealthy
people, the question naturally arises, From whom did
Immanuel obtain a MS. copy of the <i>Divina Commedia</i> that
enabled him to compose an imitation of it in Hebrew?
This perplexing question can, however, be answered in the
following manner. Although Immanuel was not in possession
of a copy of Dante's poem, he had most likely heard it
read and recited by the author himself before the members
of the political and literary society called “Young Italy,”
to which reference has already been made. And he was no
doubt so deeply impressed by the work that it remained
fresh in his memory for a number of years. It may, perhaps,
be supposed that he was thus able to write his Hebrew
imitation without actually having a written copy before him.
</p>

<p>
As regards the merits, the conception, and the style of
the <i>Ha-Topheth-ve-Ha-Eden</i> it may be said that it holds
a unique position in Hebrew literature. In the introduction
the author states that, having reached his sixtieth year,
the sudden death of a younger friend caused him much
anxiety about his own future, and he wished to know the
fate that awaited him beyond the grave. To effect this he
invoked the spirit of the Prophet Daniel. Thereupon the
vision of a venerable old man appeared to him amidst
<span class="pageno target" title="99" id="page-99"></span>
thunder and lightning, and told him that he had come to
show him his future place in the world of spirits. Immanuel
asked to be first conducted to the regions of hell, and the
old man led him there. On the way they passed through
several places, which are reminiscent of Dante's <i>Inferno</i>,
such as “a valley of corpses,” and “the gate of rejection,”
in front of which “a flaming sword turned in every
direction.” Myriads of souls were then being dragged
through the gate by evil spirits to receive their punishment
for sins committed by them in life, and on that gate the
words were inscribed: “Here is an entrance only, but no
outlet.” These words recall the passage in Dante (<i>Inferno</i>,
iii. 9):—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Abandon hope all ye who enter here.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
Passing through the gate into hell Immanuel sees tortures
inflicted upon sinners, among whom are specially mentioned
sceptics, gamblers, adulterers, misers, spendthrifts, and
hypocrites. A certain class of Jewish preachers and precentors
are also placed by Immanuel in the infernal regions,
because they were in the habit, whilst preaching or reciting
prayers, of lifting up their eyes to the women's gallery
instead of heavenwards. At the mention of these hypocrites
Immanuel, remembering his own failings, became pale with
fear. But his conductor reassured him by saying that,
though he could not pronounce him quite free from sin, yet
he hoped that his virtues and his merits as an author of
several excellent books would procure for him a seat in
Paradise. Presently Immanuel and his leader leave Hell
and betake themselves to Paradise. Looking round him,
he sees the souls of all the Biblical and post-Biblical
personages, who have in some way or other reflected credit
on the Jewish race, either by their literary works or by
their valour, honesty, and virtue. He is greeted with great
joy by Moses, David, and Solomon, who eulogize the commentaries
he had written on their literary productions.
On leaving them, Immanuel notices another group at some
distance, which was enveloped in a dazzling blaze of glory.
<span class="pageno target" title="100" id="page-100"></span>
And asking his leader who they were, he was told that they
were <i>the pious of all nations</i>
(<span class="heb" title="chasidei umoth ha'olam" xml:lang="he">חסידי אומות העולם</span>) who, during
their life on earth, had been pre-eminent in charity, virtue,
and learning, and were in consequence rewarded with seats
of honour in Paradise. Close to them Immanuel noticed
a magnificent throne in the course of erection, which he
was given to understand was to be occupied by a friend, or
rather a brother of his, as he is called, Daniel by name. It
is still a matter of uncertainty to whom the author referred.
But, on reading the context, it seems an inevitable conclusion
that he must, as Geiger suggested, have alluded to Dante
(Daniel). Near the throne of his friend, he was told, his
own would be erected, so that they might both be united
again after death and enjoy together heavenly bliss ever after.
</p>

<p>
The few special passages bearing on this friendship are
so characteristic of Immanuel's liberal-mindedness that
a reproduction of them here may not be out of place. They
run somewhat as follows:—
</p>

<p>
“I do not know what has caused me to think of my friend
Daniel, who, as an associate and friend, was to me of inestimable
worth. It was he who showed me the path of
truth and righteousness, who helped me greatly when
fortune had forsaken me, and whose gigantic intellect is
still spoken of on earth with unqualified admiration. On
my asking my guide where my own throne would be placed
after my death, he said: ‘You are certainly far inferior in
greatness to your friend, whose name and fame will always
be held in great honour by posterity. Yet, because you
have both lived after the same pattern, and have both
striven after truth, you shall be united again after death.
Your throne shall be erected near to his, and, sitting hereafter
close to each other, you will be like Joshua, who once
was the attendant and disciple of Moses. Having been
united in life by a mutual bond of friendship, no power
shall separate your souls for ever.’ When I heard this my
joy was unbounded, so happy was I in the thought that
my lot would be like his, and that we should both have
<span class="pageno target" title="101" id="page-101"></span>
seats in Paradise. And having asked my conductor to let
me see the throne destined for my friend, he took me by the
hand, and led me to a tent where the hand of a master
builder had erected a monument wonderful to view. Angels
passed to and fro, women ornamented it with different
costly textures, and numerous spirits made it ablaze with
gold, rubies, and sapphires. And soon there stood before
my wondering eye a throne formed of ebony, covered with
purple and gold, and surmounted by a beautiful, glittering
crown, which shone like the beams of the sun. This, said
my guide, is Daniel's throne. You see, my son, the work
that he has erected in the world is full of fame and renown,
and equally great and glorious shall be the throne which
he is to occupy in the world of spirits.”
</p>

<p>
The <i>Ha-Topheth-ve-Ha-Eden</i> closes with the guide's
request that he should write down for the benefit of posterity
all that he saw in his wanderings through Hell and Paradise.
Thereupon he vanishes in the tumult of a storm, which
causes the author to awake from his dream.
</p>

<p>
From what has been said it will be seen that a marked
mental affinity existed between Dante and Immanuel.
To both history, scholasticism, and romanticism provided
materials for their work. They were both influenced by
the new national spirit that had inspired the members
of “Young Italy” to struggle for the liberation of their
countrymen—bodily and mentally—from the yoke of
priestcraft and superstition. Finally, it will be admitted
that the <i>Ha-Topheth-ve-Ha-Eden</i> in style, dramatic effect,
and graphic description has much in common with the
<i>Divina Commedia</i>, although the condensed imitation is,
of course, vastly inferior to the original. Yet there are
several features in it which are peculiar to Immanuel.
The most remarkable one is this: while Dante is narrow-minded
enough to exclude from Paradise all and every
one who does not profess Christianity, including even
his leader, Virgil, Immanuel assigns places of honour there
to the good and righteous of all nations and of all ages,
<span class="pageno target" title="102" id="page-102"></span>
provided they do not deny the existence of God and of
a divine spirit in man.
</p>

<p>
Professor Th. Paur refers to this point in the essay that
was mentioned above, and writes as follows:—
</p>

<p>
“If we closely examine the sentiments set forth in the
little poetical volume (<i>Ha-Topheth-ve-Ha-Eden</i>), we must
confess that the Jew Immanuel need not blush in the presence
of the Christian Dante. It is true that he, like Dante,
condemns those philosophical theories in which the personality
of God, the creation of the world by his power, and
the existence of a divine spirit in man are denied. But
Immanuel shows more courage than Dante by effectively
stigmatizing hypocrisy in all its various shapes and forms.
He also possesses a greater spirit of tolerance than the latter
had shown towards men professing creeds different from his
own—a beautiful human <i>naïveté</i> in matters of religion—which
must be sought after with the lantern of Diogenes
among the Christians of that period.”
</p>

<p>
In the introduction to the present essay mention was
made of some sonnets composed by Immanuel in the Italian
language, which show that he must have been well versed
in the literature of his native country. Three of them were
published for the first time some thirty years ago in a
book entitled <i>Letteratura e filosofia, opuscoli per Pasquale
Garofalo, Duca di Bonita</i> (Naples, 1872). Perhaps it will
not be out of place, in conclusion, to quote one of them
here. Its English translation is somewhat as follows:—
</p>

<p>
“Love has never read the <i>Ave Maria</i>. It knows no law,
no creed, neither does it hear nor see: it is boundless. Love
is an unrestricted, omnipotent power, which insists on
obtaining what it craves for. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Love does not suffer itself
to be deprived of its pride and power by a <i>Paternoster</i>, or
by any other charm; neither is it afraid of carrying into
effect what it is fond of. <i>Amor</i> alone knows what causes
me grief; whatever I may offer him as an excuse, he meets
me always with the same answer: It is my will and wish.”

It should be added that the eminent Dante scholar, Theodor Paur,
was strongly inclined to doubt the authenticity of these poems, and that
he was sceptical with regard to the whole question of the friendship
between Immanuel and Dante. On the other hand, he readily admitted
that Immanuel imitated the <i>Commedia</i> in his <i>Ha-Topheth-ve-Ha-Eden</i>. (See
<i>Jahrbuch der deutschen Dante-Gesellschaft</i>, III, 1871, pp. 423–462.)

<a href="#toc-return-X">KALONYMOS BEN KALONYMOS</a></span></h2>

<p class="subtitle2">
A THIRTEENTH-CENTURY SATIRIST</p>

<p>
<span class="begc">During</span> the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries there
were in France, Spain, and Italy several Jewish savants
whose literary labours did much to keep alive among Jews
generally a taste for Hebrew literature as well as for philosophy
and general science. Among them was Kalonymos
ben Kalonymos, the subject of the present essay. He was
born at Arles, a small town in Provence, in the year 1287,
being the son of Kalonymos ben Meir, who bore the title of
<i>Nasi</i> (“the Prince”) and occupied a prominent position in
the local community. The management of civil affairs was
at that time in the hands of the resident archbishop, who
confined all the Jews within a single street, although their
predecessors had been permitted, since the middle of the
fourth century, to live wherever they chose<a id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor"><sup>[103-1]</sup></a>. In this
ghetto Kalonymos first saw the light, and there he also
spent a great part of his early youth, devoting much time
to the study of Biblical and Rabbinical lore, as well as the
acquisition of the classical and Oriental languages. He
subsequently continued his studies at a school in the neighbouring
town of Salon, under the tuition of Moses of Beaucaire
and Astruc of Noves<a id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor"><sup>[103-2]</sup></a>.
</p>

<p>
As a young student he easily distinguished himself by
the translation of several philosophical, mathematical, and
medical books from Arabic or Latin into Hebrew. King
Robert of Naples, who was then living in the south of
<span class="pageno target" title="104" id="page-104"></span>
France, hearing of his proficiency, commissioned him to go
to Rome and translate some Hebrew books into Latin for
him. While Kalonymos was in Rome he was a great
favourite with all who knew him intimately, and, owing to
his fine appearance, his prominent position, and his manifold
accomplishments, he had no difficulty in obtaining entry
into the best Roman society. Several of his contemporaries,
and more especially Immanuel di Roma, a friend of
Dante, speak of him in high terms, and bestow upon him,
too, his father's title of <i>Nasi</i>.
</p>

<p>
Whilst in Rome Kalonymos was asked by the leaders of
the Jewish community of Avignon, where he and his parents
had lived for some time, to come thither in order to take
a petition to the Pope, who was then residing there, praying
that he would exert his influence in favour of the Jewish
inhabitants of Avignon, for whose extermination the
Christian population had planned a secret plot. It is not
known what the result was. Graetz, in his History of the
Jews (vol. VII, p. 305), states that Kalonymos died about
the year 1337, but he does not mention the place of his
death.
</p>

<p>
Kalonymos's chief work is, by general consent, his <i>Eben
Bochan</i> (“The Touchstone”), manuscripts of which are to
be found in several libraries, including those of Munich,
Leyden, Paris, and Florence. Printed as an <i>editio princeps</i>
at Naples in 1489, a second edition appeared at Venice in
1558; it was subsequently published at Sulzbach in 1705,
and again at Fürth (without a date), and also at Lemberg
in 1865. In 1878 Dr. Kayserling edited the late Dr. Meisel's
posthumous German translation in verse, to which he
added a brief sketch in German of Kalonymos's life and
principal works.
</p>

<p>
Among the scholars who have discussed the <i>Eben Bochan</i>
may be mentioned Bartholocci, Wolf, Zunz, Geiger, Gross,
Steinschneider, and Neubauer. It is pretty generally
agreed that it was composed about the year 1324, that is to
say, at a comparatively early period of the author's life.
<span class="pageno target" title="105" id="page-105"></span>
This theory is supported by the fact that it contains passages
in which Kalonymos refers to his youth and unmarried state,
and that its style is in many places marked by a singular
freshness and vivacity which is seldom found in the writings
of older men. The work is remarkable for its conciseness
and epigrammatic force, and is further distinguished by the
ingenuity with which Biblical and Talmudical phrases are
woven into a kind of mosaic. It is somewhat similar in
style to the <i>Bechînath Olam</i>, the author of which, Yedaya
Bedaresi, was Kalonymos's contemporary. But while Bedaresi
never failed to preserve the sternness and dignity
peculiar to a moralizing philosopher, Kalonymos not infrequently
relieved the seriousness of his narrative by flashes
of humour and irony. He censures and ridicules the foibles
of his Jewish contemporaries, but confesses at the same
time, more in jest perhaps than in earnest, that he himself
was not quite innocent of the same faults. One of the
most humorous parts of the <i>Eben Bochan</i> is that at which
the author makes merry over his own misfortune in being
born a male child of Jewish parents. For as such he has
during all his lifetime to bear the heavy yoke of the six
hundred and thirteen precepts
(<span class="heb" title="tarya''g mitsvot" xml:lang="he">תרי״ג מצוות</span>),
together with
various other Talmudical restrictions. The following free

    <p class="verse">Is every Jewish son that's born;</p>
    <p class="verse">Miserable is all his life,</p>
    <p class="verse">Full of toil, and pain, and strife.</p>
    <p class="verse">Thank Heaven, life is very brief;</p>
    <p class="verse">And death soon brings a swift relief!</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
Kalonymos then goes on to say that, had Providence
decreed that he should be born a girl, his existence on earth
would have been much more pleasant.

<p>
There are other similar passages in the <i>Eben Bochan</i>, in
some of which the author ridicules, for instance, the way in
which his fellow religionists were in the habit of celebrating
the various feasts in the Jewish calendar. They entirely
overlooked, he says, the moral significance attached to these
days by their religion, but considered them to have been
specially ordained for the sake of feasting and merry-making.
Even the New Year's Day and the Day of Atonement
were not spent by them in sincere devotion, but
rather in quarrelling with each other about petty religious
usages, to which they attributed much greater weight than
they deserved.
</p>

<p>
Kalonymos elsewhere directs his attention to the prevailing
faults of his neighbours. The objects of his satire are:
the wealthy but ignorant Jewish snob; the conceited
would-be literary genius; the questionable Talmudical and
Hebrew scholar; and, lastly, the Jewish hypocrite, the man
who essays to appear outwardly religious, while his heart
is full of roguery. The latter is described by our author as
follows:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">A hypocrite is strange of race,</p>
    <p class="verse">Who, with his sanctimonious face,</p>
    <p class="verse">Would fain appear in others' view</p>
    <p class="verse">As good, benevolent, and true;</p>
    <p class="verse">Who never cares a bit or bothers</p>
    <p class="verse">About the pleasant vice of others.</p>
    <p class="verse">But though he sets up as a saint,</p>
    <p class="verse">And boasts that none has made complaint</p>
    <p class="verse">Of any dark or base transactions</p>
    <p class="verse">In business or in other actions,</p>
    <p class="verse">Yet do not on his word rely,</p>
    <p class="verse">Remember “the spider and the fly.”</p>
    <p class="verse">For cunning is the hypocrite,</p>
    <p class="verse">With shrewd and money-making wit,</p>
    <p class="verse">And plays his game to great perfection,</p>
    <p class="verse">Whene'er he can escape detection;</p>
    <p class="verse">He robs and steals whene'er he can,</p>

    <p class="verse">For once he's got it—to be plain—</p>
    <p class="verse">You'll never see your own again.</p>
    <p class="verse">Though he seems pious night and day,</p>

    <p class="verse">But yet, in truth, his heart within</p>

    <p class="verse">And he is ever a sad disgrace</p>
    <p class="verse">To Jewish creed and Jewish race.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
The prevailing tone of the <i>Eben Bochan</i> is, however,
serious. The author refers to the cruel persecutions which
the Jews suffered in the years 1320 and 1321, being occasioned
by the Shepherds and Lepers, as well as to the burning
of the Talmud at Toulouse, which took place in the year
1319, at the instigation of a certain person named Bernard
Gui. And elsewhere, again, in the same book, he appears
in the capacity of a moralizing philosopher, impressing his
readers with the necessity of making good use of their life,
as it is so very short and uncertain. On one occasion he
uses a beautiful metaphor, which is, indeed, not quite
original<a id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor"><sup>[109-1]</sup></a>, but nevertheless striking. It runs as follows:—
</p>

<p>
“The world is like a vast and endless sea, upon which
there floats a small and fragile little boat—namely, man.
It is of artistic make and form, <a id="asif"></a>and looks as if it were the
work of a master-hand. It is steered by the power of the
divine spirit that directs its course, and keeps it constantly
moving onward and onward, together with its heavy load of
cargo—that is, man's actions during his life. After having
started from the coast where it first came into existence it
<span class="pageno target" title="110" id="page-110"></span>
moves ever forward till it reaches the opposite coast, where
there lies a new realm called Eternity, which consists of
vast regions that shine with eternal light and splendour, and
also of others that are enveloped in everlasting darkness.
And God, the ruler of the universe, sits there on his throne,
surrounded by his mighty messengers, the angels, to judge
every newcomer. Now, O Son of Man! it will entirely
depend on the nature of the cargo that thou hast landed on
the opposite coast—namely, thy deeds in thy past life,
whether thou wilt be sent to the regions that glow with
eternal light, or to those in which darkness reigns supreme.”
</p>

<p>
Towards the end of the book Kalonymos states that he
composed it in honour of ten friends. Their names are as
follows:—
</p>

<p>
1. Abraham Caslari, who lived at <a id="Bezalu"></a>Bezalu, near Perpignon,
and was an eminent physician and author of several medical
books. 2. Maestro Benedit, who lived at Arles, and was
famous as a linguist and astronomer. He was also physician-in-ordinary
to Queen Joan, the wife of King Andrew of
Hungary. 3. Don Jonah Cavalier. 4. Don Todros Isaac,
of Girone. 5. Don Judah des Cartel. 6. Don Bonafoux
Shealtiel. 7. Don Bonsenor Gracian. 8. Don Chasdai
Crescas. 9. Don Samuel Beneviste, who, according to
Kayserling, was physician-in-ordinary to Don Pedro IV,
king of Aragon. 10. Don Astruc Crespin.
</p>

<p>
Kalonymos says at the end of the <i>Eben Bochan</i> that he
finished it when he was eighty-three years old
(<span class="heb" title="ben shalosh ushmonim shana" xml:lang="he">בן שלש ושמונים שנה</span>),
while it is generally supposed that he died at the
age of fifty. The only explanation that can be given of
this discrepancy is, that the copyist of the manuscript may
have put down by mistake that number for
<span class="heb" title="ben sheloshim veshmoneh" xml:lang="he">בן שלשים ושמונה</span>
<span dir="ltr">=38</span>,
which would just be the time when Kalonymos was
staying at Rome.
</p>

<p>
Less popular, though not less humorous, than the <i>Eben
Bochan</i> is Kalonymos's <i>Massecheth Purim</i>, the whole title
of which in Hebrew is given as follows:—
</p>

<p class="center dirrtl">
<span class="heb" title="Sefer megillat setarim vesefer masechet purim" xml:lang="he">ספר מגלת סתרים וספר מסכת פורים</span>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="pageno target" title="111" id="page-111"></span>
It would appear that it was intended by the author to be
a parody on the manner in which Rabbis generally conducted
discussions and debates on trivial questions, as
described in the Talmud, with special reference to the rites
and usages connected with the Feast of Purim. It was
obviously a harmless Purim prank, yet some ultra-orthodox
Rabbis<a id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor"><sup>[111-1]</sup></a> took it seriously, and declared it to be an heretical
work. Its want of popularity among Jewish readers in
past centuries, and the limited number of its editions, must
be attributed to this. It has only been printed three times
altogether, first at Pesaro in 1507, then at Venice in 1552,
and lastly at Vienna in 1871.
</p>

<p>
The Rabbis may have had yet another reason for their
objections to the work, as the author advocates therein some
slight reforms in the ritual of Purim. He puts, for instance,
in the mouth of one of the disputants the question: Why
should it be forbidden to read the <i>Megillah</i> on Purim in the
vernacular, being a language that is generally better understood,
by Jews and Jewesses alike, than Hebrew? Should an
objection (he goes on to say) be made to such a procedure on
the plea that the Book of Esther contains the word
<span class="heb" title="kichtavam" xml:lang="he">ככתבם</span>,
which means “according to their (the Jews’) own writing,”
this obstacle could easily be removed by having the vernacular
translation written in Hebrew characters.
</p>

<p>
Incidentally we learn from the <i>Massecheth Purim</i> that
the Jews then living in Palestine were well-to-do farmers,
and that those living in France and Italy frequently indulged
in a certain game called
<span class="heb" title="skakeri" xml:lang="he">סקקרי</span>,
which, according to Steinschneider,
is equivalent to the Italian term <i>il schachiere</i>,
and means the chess board<a id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor"><sup>[111-2]</sup></a>. We likewise gather from the
book that the Rabbis of that time allowed dancing, provided
that the dancers chose their partners from their own sex.
<span class="pageno target" title="112" id="page-112"></span>
It is interesting to notice, in passing, the variety of dishes
which the Jewish ladies of those times were in the habit of
preparing for the festivals. Kalonymos mentions, by way
of example, the wife of the president of a certain Italian
Jewish community, called Kardinalith
<span class="heb" title="kardinalith" xml:lang="he">קרדינלית</span>, who used
to begin making the preparations at least a fortnight before
the advent of any Jewish festival. Graetz's supposition<a id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor"><sup>[112-1]</sup></a>,
that the lady in question was a Cardinal's daughter, is not
supported by any historical evidence.
</p>

<p>
The third original work of Kalonymos is entitled <i>The
Letter of Response</i>
(<span class="heb" title="iggeret hateshuvah" xml:lang="he">אגרת התשובה</span>),
addressed to the well-known
Jewish philosopher Don Bonafoux Ibn Caspi (1280–1340),
in which the latter's commentary on the Bible is
critically reviewed, and especially his leaning to what is
now called “the higher criticism”. Kalonymos expresses
the opinion that it is unwise and even dangerous to meddle
with the ideas which people may have formed in early life
regarding the sacred volume, and that Ibn Caspi's commentary
on it was therefore doing more harm than good.
Incidentally we learn from <i>The Letter of Response</i> that
the writer was at the time of penning it a struggling youth,
while Caspi was a man of affluence and position. It should,
perhaps, also be mentioned that it existed at Munich in
manuscript form till 1879, and that it was then published
for the first time by the late Dr. Perles of Munich, under
the title of <i>Kalonymos' Sendschreiben an Josef Caspi</i>.
</p>

<p>
The fourth and last original work of Kalonymos is
entitled <i>The Book of Kings</i>
(<span class="heb" title="sefer hamelachim" xml:lang="he">ספר מלכים</span>),
and deals chiefly
with arithmetic, geometry, and astrology. It has hardly
any intrinsic value at the present time as a scientific book,
but deserves to be noticed because it was one of the few
books which, as its title seems to indicate, was expressly
written for the use of King Robert of Naples. It has
never been printed, but exists as a MS. in Munich, where
it was discovered some little time ago by Steinschneider<a id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor"><sup>[112-2]</sup></a>.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="113" id="page-113"></span>
</div>

<p>
Kalonymos also made translations of works in various
languages, the titles of some of which will be quoted at the
end of this essay. One of these, however, deserves special
mention. That is the
<span class="heb" title="iggeret ba'alei chaim" xml:lang="he">אגרת בעלי חיים</span>,
which consists of a free
Hebrew translation of part of an Arabic work then in circulation
under the title of <i>The Treatises of the Righteous
Brethren</i>, and was edited by a certain Abalzapha<a id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor"><sup>[113-1]</sup></a>. It is
a fairy tale, containing a dialogue between men and beasts,
in the presence of the king of birds, in which the question
is discussed, whether man has a right to dominate over
the world or not<a id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor"><sup>[113-2]</sup></a>. Kalonymos invests this theme with a
Jewish colouring by giving the chief part of the discussion
to a Hebrew from the East, who is determined to prove by
argument that the confessors of his own creed, at least,
occupy a higher rank in the world than the animals. The
former, he says, are the progeny of a noble line, and Moses
and the other prophets have furnished them with numerous
wise laws and regulations as to their proper conduct in life.
They have, besides, temples and synagogues to pray in, as
well as preachers and precentors to listen to, and their
feasts and fasts afford them recreation for body and mind.
In these advantages and pleasures, says the Hebrew in
conclusion, the winged creatures do not participate, and it
is therefore evident that they were destined by their Creator
to be ruled by his chosen race.
</p>

<p>
The king of the birds replies that the Hebrew's arguments
prove the reverse of what they were intended to prove.
For the very fact that the confessors of the Jewish creed
need laws and preachers, penitential and fast-days, shows
clearly enough that they are not free from sin; and this being
so, they have certainly no right to claim superiority over the
winged creatures whose life is distinguished by simplicity
and innocence. To them the whole universe is one gigantic
temple wherein they sing daily praises to their Creator
<span class="pageno target" title="114" id="page-114"></span>
with a pure heart and clear conscience. They need no
preachers to admonish them, nor do they require fasts to
obtain absolution for their transgressions. Finding, as they
do, food and shelter in the fields and gardens, on mountains
and in the valleys, they are always cheerful and happy
without the aid of prescribed festivals, but their happiness
is often disturbed by the wickedness of man, who has no
right whatever to treat them as inferior to his own
species.
</p>

<p>
In the introduction to the
<span class="heb" title="iggeret ba'alei chaim" xml:lang="he">אגרת בעלי חיים</span>
and elsewhere
Kalonymos censures the extravagant mode of living which
prevailed among his wealthy Jewish contemporaries.
He stigmatizes their intense fondness for display, which
asserted itself so strongly as to arouse the envy and hatred
of the general population, and frequently with lamentable
results.
</p>

<p>
Kalonymos was therefore not merely a laughing philosopher
like Democritus, but a stern moralist who ridiculed
certain objectionable characteristics of the Jews, indicating
thereby the way to self-restraint and good taste. There is
also an interesting remark to be found in the
<span class="heb" title="iggeret ba'alei chaim" xml:lang="he">אגרת בעלי חיים</span>,
which is to the effect that in Kalonymos's time the
Greek philosophers were reputed to have made frequent
use of the books on philosophy composed by Jewish
writers<a id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor"><sup>[114-1]</sup></a>.
</p>

<p>
A few remarks have still to be made on Kalonymos's
style. He writes partly in plain and partly in rhymed
prose, without, however, much elegance in either. His
excessive fondness for idiomatic phrases taken from the
Talmud, which he misapplies with extraordinary ingenuity,
results in puns, plays on words, especially on proper names.
The following example will give an idea of the nature of the
whole. It does not, however, bear translation, as the idiomatic
point of the Hebrew cannot be reproduced in English.
In the <i>Eben Bochan</i> there is a chapter wherein Kalonymos
<span class="pageno target" title="115" id="page-115"></span>
ridicules the way in which the Hebrew grammarians of his
time quarrelled in regard to the importance which should
be assigned to the accents
(<span class="heb" title="te'amim" xml:lang="he">טעמים</span>)
attached to the Hebrew
text of the Bible. Some of them were regarded in the light
of the cabbala, and were believed to contain the most
profound secrets regarding the present and future world.
Kalonymos writes about these disputants as follows:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container dirrtl">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verseh"><span class="heb" title="ani ra'iti machlokah gedolah" xml:lang="he">אני ראיתי מחלוקה גדולה</span></p>
    <p class="verseh"><span class="heb" title="be'inyan qadma veazla" xml:lang="he">בענין <span class="over">קדמא</span> <span class="over">ואזלא</span></span></p>
    <p class="verseh"><span class="heb" title="veriv gadol 'ad shehadam nispach" xml:lang="he">וריב גדול עד שהדם נשפך</span></p>
    <p class="verseh"><span class="heb" title="be'inyan shofar mehuppach" xml:lang="he">בענין <span class="over">שופר</span> <span class="over">מהפך</span></span></p>
    <p class="verseh"><span class="heb" title="vemihem omrim me'et Moshe safra rabba beisrael kabir" xml:lang="he">ומהם אומרים מעת משה ספרא רבא בישראל קביר</span></p>
    <p class="verseh"><span class="heb" title="lo nihie sod 'amok kemo lifney darga tevir" xml:lang="he">לא נהיה סוד עמוק כמו לפני <span class="over">דרגא</span> <span class="over">תביר</span>.</span></p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
An instance of his plays on words may be given. He
noticed that some of his neighbours did not abstain from
drinking great quantities of wine during the so-called ten
penitential days. He therefore gives them two Hebrew
names by which some of Haman's sons are known, viz.
<span class="heb" title="Parshandata" xml:lang="he">פרשנדתא</span>
and <span class="heb" title="Hamedata" xml:lang="he">המדתא</span>.
These names are composed of the
words <span class="heb" title="parash-data" xml:lang="he">פרש־דתא</span> and
<span class="heb" title="hamem-data" xml:lang="he">המם־דתא</span>,
which mean respectively “to
be separated from, and, to distort, the law,” and they thus
depict epigrammatically and wittily the religious character
of the objects of Kalonymos's satire.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the
<span class="heb" title="iggeret ba'aley chaim" xml:lang="he">אגרת בעלי חיים</span>
Kalonymos also translated
several other works and treatises composed by other
authors in the Arabic, Greek, and Latin languages, which
deal chiefly with medicine, mathematics, and astronomy.
A detailed description of them will be found in the
interesting book entitled <i>Les Écrivains Juifs français du
XIV<sup>e</sup> siècle</i>, p. 424, by Neubauer. One of these translations,
entitled <span class="heb" title="iggeret besiddur kriyat hachochmoth" xml:lang="he">אגרת בסדור קריאת החכמות</span>,
contains the significant
remark that it was made by Kalonymos by command of
King Robert of Naples. The king is there designated by
the curious name of “The New Solomon.”
</p>

<p>
There are likewise some few books and treatises in
<span class="pageno target" title="116" id="page-116"></span>
existence, treating of various subjects, the authorship of
which is attributed to Kalonymos. Among these may
specially be mentioned a Hebrew translation of a circular
letter sent by the above-named king to the Jewish community
of Aix, containing the intelligence of his son's
death.

<a href="#toc-return-XI">ABRAHAM IBN CHASDAI</a></span></h2>

<p class="subtitle2">
AND HIS BOOK
“THE PRINCE AND THE DERVISH”</p>

<p>
<span class="begc">Among</span> the minor Hebrew poets who lived at Barcelona
in the early part of the thirteenth century there is, perhaps,
none more remarkable than Abraham Ibn Chasdai. Little
is known of him beyond what may be gathered from a letter
addressed by him to his friend Alfakar. From it we learn
that the writer was a native of Barcelona and a contemporary
of the famous Hebrew grammarian David Kimchi
(1160–1232), who is referred to there as <i>Hazakan</i> (“the
old man”).
</p>

<p>
According to some historians<a id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor"><sup>[117-1]</sup></a> Abraham Ibn Chasdai was
the spiritual head of the Barcelona Jewish community, but
it is not impossible that he also may have been somewhat
intimately connected with the medical profession. In his
book <i>The Prince and the Dervish</i> there are several references
to the healing art and its many intricacies, which suggest
more than a superficial acquaintance with the subject.
But there is no doubt whatever that Ibn Chasdai was an
eminent Hebrew and Talmudical scholar, and that he had
a considerable knowledge of Arabic and Greek, which
enabled him to translate into Hebrew some books written
in these two languages<a id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor"><sup>[117-2]</sup></a>.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="118" id="page-118"></span>
</div>

<p>
His only book, however, which has a permanent literary
and ethical value is <i>The Prince and the Dervish</i>. Though
it is only a free Hebrew translation of an Arabic book,
which was in itself a mere version of a volume that had
originally been composed in Greek, it has always enjoyed
much popularity among readers of neo-Hebrew literature.
It has not only been repeatedly published<a id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor"><sup>[118-1]</sup></a>, but it has also
been translated into several languages, including Latin<a id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor"><sup>[118-2]</sup></a>,
Spanish, and Jewish German.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Prince and the Dervish</i> possesses in an eminent
degree the qualities which make any book attractive, viz.
a pleasing style and interesting subject-matter. In style
it is a happy imitation of that found in the Bible, and is
remarkable for the ingenuity with which certain verses
thereof are used in a somewhat different sense from that
which they have in it.
</p>

<p>
It consists of thirty-five chapters, full of charming tales
and fables, together with many valuable maxims and
proverbs. Rhymed prose intermingled with verse is generally
used. The subject-matter is derived chiefly from the
Talmud and the Midrash, but partly also from other
Oriental sources. It is curious to note that several of the
stories have been reproduced in a somewhat modified form
by Boccaccio, Lafontaine, and other writers belonging to
more modern times. But they possess a special characteristic
of their own—they invariably end with a moral.
</p>

<p>
Passing now to a more detailed account of its contents,
it is necessary to give the story, which is the framework
within which the subordinate episodes are included. It
runs as follows:—
</p>

<p>
“Once upon a time there lived in a certain state in India
<span class="pageno target" title="119" id="page-119"></span>
a cruel and despotic king, who only lived for his own enjoyment.
He hated, in consequence, every kind of religious
restriction, and even persecuted those of his subjects who,
like the members belonging to the sect of the so-called
Dervishes, led a retiring and ascetic life. His hatred
of them acquired additional intensity when the chief of
his courtiers disappeared one day from the palace, and
was reported to have become a Dervish himself. A royal
decree was issued, which forbade the Dervishes to remain
in any part of the king's dominions, and which at the
same time fixed a severe penalty for any disregard of the
proclamation.
</p>

<p>
“Now it so happened that soon after this event a son
and heir to the throne was born to the king. He summoned
his astrologers to tell him of the future destiny of the newborn
prince, and was informed that the prince would in
the future become a great friend of the Dervishes, and
favour and promote their cause. Thereupon the king
ordered that the infant prince should be taken to a secluded
castle, which stood upon a solitary island, and that he
should be kept there under the closest surveillance until
the time when he should ascend the throne. This order
was strictly observed and carried out for a number of years
by the king's servants. But when the prince had grown
up, he was allowed by them to walk about the island by
himself. Now on one of his walks the prince came across a
strange looking man, who was sitting and meditating in
a lonely spot near the sea. This man was the former chief
courtier of the king who, as already stated, had joined the
sect of Dervishes, and afterwards led a vagrant life.
The strange appearance and peculiar attire of the Dervish
attracted the attention of the prince, who, having engaged
him in conversation, was so greatly charmed with it that
he expressed a desire to have this interesting meeting
repeated. The Dervish consented, and in their subsequent
meetings many topics, including chiefly theology, ethics,
and philosophy, were discussed. The Dervish, according
<span class="pageno target" title="120" id="page-120"></span>
to the Eastern fashion, wove tales, fables, and maxims into
his discourses, which interested the prince so much that he
offered the Dervish his life-long friendship as a mark of
his sincere attachment to him. He also assured him that
he would extend his favour to the whole sect of Dervishes
as soon as he should succeed to his father's throne.”
</p>

<p>
Before proceeding to give some extracts from <i>The Prince
and the Dervish</i> it should be observed that, as already
stated before, it is written in rhymed prose, intermixed
with rather heavy verse, it is impossible to translate them
literally or fully. The few passages, however, that are here
rendered will no doubt be sufficient to enable the reader
to form some notion of the most interesting portion of
the book.
</p>

<p>
One of the best moral stories that occur in <i>The Prince
and the Dervish</i> is the following<a id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor"><sup>[120-1]</sup></a>. It runs thus:—
</p>

<p>
“In the far East there was a little island, the inhabitants
of which had some strange customs, notably in regard to
their selection of a king to rule over them. Being averse
to an hereditary monarchy, they used to go once every
year to the sea-shore, and choose the first poor and shipwrecked
stranger whom they happened to meet there as
their king. As such, he was driven in a state coach to
a magnificent palace, and there he was permitted to enjoy
for a whole year all the rights and privileges possessed by
an Eastern potentate. But, as soon as the year of his reign
was over, the king was stripped of his royal garments,
brought back to the very spot where he had been found,
and there left to himself.
</p>

<p>
“Once, however, it so happened that the stranger, whom
they had selected as their king, was a prudent man and
experienced in worldly matters. Astonished at his sudden
elevation, he made inquiries of one of the islanders whose
confidence he had gained, and learned from him the real
reason. He accordingly devised a plan, from which he
<span class="pageno target" title="121" id="page-121"></span>
hoped that he and his friend would derive some lasting
advantage. They were simply to go on a dark night to
the state treasury, and to take away from thence a quantity
of jewels (which by right were the king's property for the
time being), and hide them in a cave near the sea; they
would thus have some means of subsistence when the year
of the king's reign ended. The plan was speedily carried
into effect. After his year's reign was over, he was taken
back to the place whence he had come. He and his friend
took possession of their hidden treasure, and with it they
went on board a passing ship, which brought them to a
foreign country, where the sale of their valuables enabled
them to live a life of comfort and happiness.”
</p>

<p>
This tale was related by the Dervish to the prince, in
the course of one of their conversations, as an illustration
of human life. When we come into existence, the Dervish
said, we are, every one of us, helpless and poor, but after
we have grown up we have at our disposal all the wealth
and delights which this beautiful world of ours offers to
all men. But we must never ignore the fact that our stay
on earth is but brief, and that we are thus, as it were,
kings for one year only. It therefore behoves man to
devote his brief existence to the performance of noble
deeds which will, when his life is ended in this world,
procure him in the world to come God's everlasting favour
and grace.
</p>

<p>
All the tales contained in <i>The Prince and the Dervish</i>
are not, however, of this character; there are several of
a purely diverting nature. To the latter class of tales
belongs the one which treats of a large doll (chap. 31),
and resembles in several respects some of the frivolous
stories that occur in Boccaccio's <i>Decameron</i>. This tale,
which the curious will have to read in the Hebrew
original, shows up the fickleness of will and the infidelity
of women generally. The author here follows the example
set by several mediaeval Hebrew satirists, such as Bedaresi,
Immanuel, Alcharizi, Sabbatai, Zabara, and others, who
<span class="pageno target" title="122" id="page-122"></span>
made womankind the butt of their wit. In the same
volume a whole chapter (the 18th) is devoted to love. One
of the principal virtues of this passion, the author says, is
that it often brings into prominence certain good qualities
in the lover which might otherwise have remained concealed.
To win his lady's affection he would become
courageous, active, liberal, and fond of jovial society. But
love, the author goes on to say in true Eastern fashion,
has also its demerits, for it often brings its devotees to
destruction. It not seldom happens that he who has been
captivated by the charms of a fair woman gets indolent,
and spends much of his time in the pursuit of distractions.
He thus squanders his possessions, and is reduced to
poverty. As a poor man he has many cares, which weaken
him both in mind and body, and throw him on the bed of
sickness. His illness is frequently fatal, and he thus pays
the penalty of unrestrained passion with his life.
</p>

<p>
In the same chapter several charming love poems occur,
which resemble in form and style those of Judah Halevy,
Ibn Ezra, and Alcharizi. One of these pieces, supposed
to have been addressed by a lover to a maiden, who had
ignored his avowed affection for her, runs as follows:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Thrice cruel maid, may Heaven frown on thee,</p>
    <p class="verse">For that by day thou hidest thyself from me,</p>
    <p class="verse">And yet thou robbest me of my nightly rest,</p>
    <p class="verse">For that thy face is in my eyes impressed.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
Another instance, showing how a subject is treated by
the author in two different ways, is found in chapter 17.
There the question of travelling is discussed by the prince
and the Dervish, and they arrive at the conclusion that
travelling, which affords recreation for body and mind, is
specially commendable to a man who is worn out with
cares and troubles, as the change of scenery and climate
cannot but be beneficial to him. And indeed, says the
author, were travelling not conducive to health and happiness,
God would surely not have commanded his faithful
servant Abraham, saying, “Get thee out of thy birthplace,
<span class="pageno target" title="123" id="page-123"></span>
and rove through the country” (Gen. xii. 1). Elsewhere
in the same chapter travelling is depicted in different
colours. It is, he says, fatiguing and by no means pleasant;
for it deprives man of his home comforts, and causes him
to renounce the society of dear and devoted friends, who
make his life happy for him. That travelling is not a
boon the author proves by the fact that Cain of the Bible
was told by God to expiate the sin of his crime by being
a restless wanderer over the earth (cp. Gen. iv. 12).
</p>

<p>
A special feature of <i>The Prince and the Dervish</i> is the
fable, which often serves as an illustration of the subject
under discussion. The following<a id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor"><sup>[123-1]</sup></a> is a specimen:—
</p>

<p>
“King Solomon, to whom legend ascribes the knowledge
of all languages, including those supposed to be spoken
by animals, once gave an audience to a wealthy Jewish
farmer, and received from him a costly present. To show
his appreciation of the gift, the king offered to bestow
upon the farmer any favour he might ask. But, to the
king's surprise, the farmer asked the favour of being
initiated by the king into the secret of understanding the
language spoken by farm-yard animals. After some hesitation
the king granted the farmer's request, impressing
him, however, with the necessity of not divulging the
secret to anybody else under penalty of immediate death.
</p>

<p>
“Now it so happened that the farmer had a shrew for
a wife, and, wishing to live in peace with her, allowed
himself to be ruled by her in all domestic affairs. One
day, while occupied in the farm-yard, he overheard a conversation
between an ox and an ass, which amused him
so much that he burst out laughing. At that moment his
wife appeared, and insisted on being told the joke. He
begged her not to press him to disclose a secret, on the
keeping of which his very life depended. But she remained
obdurate. Seeing that there was no way out of
the difficulty, he told her that he would fulfil her desire
<span class="pageno target" title="124" id="page-124"></span>
in a few days, but that he had in the meantime to settle
his worldly affairs, before going to meet his inevitable
and premature death. To this she agreed. Next day,
while again standing in the farm-yard, he heard his dog
rebuking the cock for crowing as loudly as ever, though
he was aware of his master's approaching death. But the
cock said that since their master was a coward and a fool,
he did not deserve to be pitied by anybody. ‘Let him,’ said
the cock, ‘take a lesson from me, and his life will certainly
be saved. There are in the farm-yard a number of hens,
who all obey me implicitly, as they know very well that
any case of disobedience on their part would be attended
with a well-deserved punishment. Now, our master has
only <i>one</i> wife to deal with, and if he is idiotic enough to
allow her to rule over him, he must bear the consequences.’
</p>

<p>
“When the farmer heard the cock's wise remarks he
regained courage, and presently meeting his wife, he told
her that he refused to let her know his secret, and that
he was fully determined to be and to remain the ruler in
his own house from that time forward. These words had
the desired effect, and from that day forth he lived with
his wife in harmony and undisturbed peace.”
</p>

<p>
<i>The Prince and the Dervish</i> is also exceedingly rich
in pithy maxims, of which the following may serve as
examples. On the question of paying visits to one's
friends, he says<a id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor"><sup>[124-1]</sup></a>:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Go not too frequently thy friends to see,</p>
    <p class="verse">Lest they grow weary of the sight of thee;</p>
    <p class="verse">When rain is scanty, then we pray for more,</p>
    <p class="verse">But love not one continuous downpour.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
Another maxim is reminiscent of the Biblical saying
“For man looketh on the outward appearance, but the
Lord looketh on the heart” (1 Sam. xvi. 7). It runs
thus:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Let not his humble vesture make thee blind</p>
    <p class="verse">To one whose greatness is a learnèd mind:</p>
<span class="pageno target" title="125" id="page-125"></span>
    <p class="verse">For pearls may sometimes in the sand be found,</p>
    <p class="verse">And stores of gold lie buried in the ground<a id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor"><sup>[125-1]</sup></a>.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
Humility of mind is thus spoken of<a id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor"><sup>[125-2]</sup></a>:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Be ever meek and humble, nor essay</p>
    <p class="verse">In path of pride and haughtiness to stray:</p>
    <p class="verse">The tempest spares the hyssop on the wall,</p>
    <p class="verse">But 'neath its wrath the proudest cedars fall.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
The following lines must have been written when a
dear friend was about to take leave of him. They run
thus<a id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor"><sup>[125-3]</sup></a>:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Now that the time has come for us to part,</p>
    <p class="verse">I feel how much thy loss means to my heart;</p>
    <p class="verse">For when the sun sinks suddenly to rest,</p>
    <p class="verse">'Tis then that darkness grows most manifest.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
Of a more humorous nature are the following lines<a id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor"><sup>[125-4]</sup></a> put
in the form of questions and answers:—
</p>

<div class="block-quote">
<p>
<i>Question.</i> What is the most useful thing to any man in life?
</p>

<p>
<i>Answer.</i> Knowledge, or wealth, or a good and loving wife.
</p>

<p>
<i>Question.</i> But, if none of these commodities man has ever got?
</p>

<p>
<i>Answer.</i> Then by keeping golden silence he might improve his lot.
</p>

<p>
<i>Question.</i> And if he cannot do so, that poor and hapless knave?
</p>

<p>
<i>Answer.</i> Then let him go away at once, and dig himself a grave.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Apart from the literary value which <i>The Prince and the
Dervish</i> possesses, it has a special importance which recalls
to mind that all its versions have been rendered by
Jewish writers into different languages. This fact lends
support to the theory that the Jews have always displayed
a peculiar aptitude in the translation of books, and more
especially from Arabic, Greek, and Latin, into the sacred
tongue of the Bible. By this means they preserved to
posterity many valuable literary works which might
otherwise have remained unknown or even perished.
Among the more prominent Jewish translators living
in mediaeval times were, besides several members of the
famous Tibbon family, Kalonymos ben Kalonymos, Moses
<span class="pageno target" title="126" id="page-126"></span>
di Rieti, Immanuel di Roma, Alcharizi, Judah Romano, Elias
del Medigo, and last, but not least, Abraham Ibn Chasdai,
the author of <i>The Prince and the Dervish</i>. It should
also be observed that several learned Jewish linguists
have, in more modern times, been greatly helpful, in a
literary sense, to many of their less educated co-religionists
by introducing to them in a Hebrew garb some of the
best-known works of general literature, including Homer,
Virgil, Horace, Shakespeare, Milton, Dante, Racine, Schiller,
and Goethe. Thus it is interesting to note that the language
of the Bible has, like the Bible itself, at all times
rendered most valuable services to Jews as well as to
those of other creeds.

<span class="subtitle">
<a href="#toc-return-XII">ISAAC ERTER</a></span></h2>

<p class="subtitle2">
A MODERN HEBREW HUMORIST</p>

<p>
<span class="begc">Though</span> Hebrew literature is commonly reckoned as one
of the ancient literatures it has an advantage over them
which is not inconsiderable. It is that while no other ancient
literature can be said to have ever risen to any remarkable
height of excellence after the close of its golden age, in the
case of the Hebrew there were at least three noteworthy
revivals after its first classical period had ended. The
first occurred some time about the return of the ancient
Hebrews from the Babylonian exile to Palestine; the
second during the Middle Ages in Spain, France, and Italy;
and the third in modern times in Galicia, a country which
forms part of the Austrian empire. During the second
half of the eighteenth century a small band of writers of
Hebrew prose and poetry, who may be regarded as the
founders of what is now termed the Galician school,
flourished there. The foremost representative of the school
was Isaac Erter.
</p>

<p>
He was born in the year 1792 in a small Galician village
called Janischock. His father, a poor innkeeper, in spite
of his indigence, did not neglect to have his son educated
in Hebrew and Talmudical lore. When young Erter had
made some progress in these studies, which, by the way, he
only learnt mechanically and on no fixed plan, his father
caused him to marry a Rabbi's daughter, who, however,
died within the first year after their marriage. Old Erter,
however, insisted upon his son marrying again; and the
second marriage proved a very happy one, in spite of the
difficulties which a married man with no definite means of
<span class="pageno target" title="128" id="page-128"></span>
subsistence is bound to encounter. Perhaps to relieve the
monotony of his life he mixed with the members of a strange
religious sect known by the name of “Chassidim.” Their
chief characteristics were the hilarity and excitement of
their lives, and their passionate devotion to their spiritual
leader called “Rebbe.” Although these “Rebbes” are, as
a rule, illiterate persons, they are nevertheless held in
high esteem by their devotees, who credit them with the
possession of supernatural powers, by means of which they
are able to work miracles. But, after a time, Erter grew
weary of this society and its absurd practices, and went to
live at Lemberg, the capital of Galicia. There he soon
became acquainted with several young men of talent and
culture who interested themselves on his behalf, and procured
him pupils whom he instructed in Hebrew and religious
subjects. They also made him acquainted with the works
of Maimonides and Mendelssohn, to the study of which he
later on devoted many of his leisure hours. He here
passed three happy years (from 1813 to 1816), and enjoyed
the society and friendship of some genial spirits, among
whom may particularly be mentioned Rapoport, afterwards
Chief Rabbi of Prague, and Nachman Krochmal, the
renowned Hebrew scholar and philosopher. Subsequently
when Jacob Ornstein, the then Chief Rabbi of Lemberg,
heard of the existence among his flock of a small and
youthful band who occupied themselves with the study of
secular subjects, he became alarmed, and forthwith excommunicated
all the culprits. The immediate effect of this
upon Erter was the loss of his pupils, and with them of his
livelihood. He consequently decided to settle in the neighbouring
town of Brody. On his arrival there he met with
a hearty reception from the enlightened section of the
Jewish community, and as a new Jewish school had just
been inaugurated there he was entrusted with its management.
After a short time, however, he resigned his position,
and made up his mind to prepare himself for a more independent
calling. With this object Erter left his grown-up
<span class="pageno target" title="129" id="page-129"></span>
family of daughters in charge of some friends and went to
Buda-Pesth, at the university of which town he intended
to prepare himself for the medical profession. He was then
thirty-three years old, and had neither money nor friends
to assist him, but after five years' hard study, accompanied
by severe privations, he succeeded in passing all the necessary
examinations, and took his degree, and soon after
began to practise in the country. It so happened that at
that time the cholera was raging, and as Erter displayed
considerable skill in dealing with the epidemic, he drew
upon himself the attention of the Austrian government,
which entrusted him with the task of preparing certain
essays, treating of the origin and spread of contagious
diseases. Ultimately he returned to Brody, and continued
to practise there, making himself especially popular among
the poor, who found in him a kindly benefactor. His
leisure time he devoted to his favourite occupation, the
composition of Hebrew essays, or rather satires on Jewish
subjects. He usually sent them to his literary friends to
be read and criticized before allowing them to be printed
in the current Hebrew periodicals. Among them he reckoned,
in addition to Rapoport and Krochmal, Professor S. D.
Luzzatto, Shalom Cohen (editor of the Hebrew periodical
<i>Bikurey-Ha-Ittim</i>, and Dr. Letteris, the subsequent editor
and publisher of Erter's collected writings under the title of
<span class="heb" title="Hatsofeh lebeth Israel" xml:lang="he">הצופה לבית ישראל</span><a id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor" dir="ltr"><sup>[129-1]</sup></a>.
</p>

<p>
The last years of Erter's life were again visited by various
trials, chiefly caused by the untimely death of his two
married daughters, to whom he had been deeply attached.
He did not, however, survive them long. He died in the
year 1851.
</p>

<p>
From what has been said it will be seen that Erter's life
was a hard one, and it is to this very circumstance that
the existence of the excellent Hebrew satires contained in
the <i>Zophe</i> is due. His sad experiences during the early
<span class="pageno target" title="130" id="page-130"></span>
part of his married life, his association with the “Chassidim,”
the treatment he had received at the hands of the
Chief Rabbi of Lemberg, and, finally, the observations he had
made in his capacity as a medical practitioner—all these,
and many other things, are graphically described therein.
His style is full of humour and sarcasm, and the book
possesses the true mark of excellence, inasmuch as familiarity
with it merely adds to its attractiveness. Erter also
wrote some poetical pieces, but they bear no comparison
with his masterly prose, which, as Graetz well says, has
points of resemblance to that of Heine.
</p>

<p>
The titles of the satires in question are:
<span dir="ltr">1. <span class="heb" title="Meozney mishkal" xml:lang="he">מאזני משקל</span>.</span>
<span dir="ltr">2. <span class="heb" title="Hatsofeh beshuvo miKarlsbad" xml:lang="he">הצופה בשובו מקארלסבאד</span>.</span>
<span dir="ltr">3. <span class="heb" title="Gilgul nefesh" xml:lang="he">גלגול נפש</span>.</span>
<span dir="ltr">4. <span class="heb" title="Tashlich" xml:lang="he">תשליך</span>.</span>
<span dir="ltr">5. <span class="heb" title="Tlunot Sani veSansani veSamangaluf" xml:lang="he">תלונת סני וסנסני וסמנגלוף</span>.</span>
<span dir="ltr">6. <span class="heb" title="Chasidut vechochmah" xml:lang="he">חסידות וחכמה</span>,</span>
and each section treats
of a different subject. It would be no easy task for any
one to reproduce in English, or in any other language, the
many beauties of form and style found in the original
Hebrew of these satires. Equally difficult would it be to
arrange them in order of merit, since each has a peculiar
charm of its own. But the following free translation of
some parts of the satire, entitled
<span class="heb" title="Gilgul nefesh" xml:lang="he">גלגול נפש</span>
(“Transmigration
of the Soul”), may, perhaps, give the reader a faint
idea of Erter's methods. It begins as follows:—
</p>

<p>
“I am a physician, and it is my duty to heal the wounds,
and to procure a remedy for every disease of the body.
It is true that those of my colleagues, who can boast of
possessing high-sounding titles, look down upon me with
a certain contempt, inasmuch as they think that they alone
have a right to speak with authority of things they do not
know much about. But I am, nevertheless, as well qualified
a medical practitioner as they are, and my patients do
not fare worse than theirs. The only difference between
them and myself is, perhaps, to be found in the fact that
they drive to their patients' houses in splendid carriages,
while I visit mine on foot. For the more horses and
carriages a physician has, the more knowledge and medical
skill is attributed to him by the members of the Jewish
<span class="pageno target" title="131" id="page-131"></span>
faith. Moreover, these distinguished and betitled physicians,
who are mostly employed by the wealthy classes of
the community, are generally handsomely rewarded for
their services, even when their patients die an untimely
death, for among the rich even death is an expensive affair.
But I, whose chief practice is carried on among the poor,
am seldom rewarded for my services, and if any of them
die, then his or her soul ‘goes out for nothing.’
</p>

<p>
“I once passed in front of the house in which one of my
patients had died shortly before. He did not die quite
suddenly, but had been ill for some time, and I was called
in to prescribe for him. He happened to be well off, and
after I had visited him once or twice, and he got no better,
a great crowd of his female neighbours and relations came—for
the rich are always surrounded by their relatives and
pretended friends—and said compassionately: ‘This poor
sufferer is still in bed, and shall we keep silence? Can
that man (pointing to me) be expected to restore him to
health again? Where are his horses, and where is his
carriage? Let us call in some better and more skilful men,
and let them have a consultation about the case!’ Better
and more skilful men were summoned; they arrived and
examined the patient. They then nodded their wise heads,
and prescribed a new medicine, which, having been fetched
from the apothecary's shop, was given to the patient. He
took it once or twice, and was soon after ‘gathered to his
fathers.’”
</p>

<p>
Here follows a long and humorous description of the
author's meeting with the soul of his recently departed
patient. The soul told him the story of its many adventures
during its long earthly career; how it frequently
passed over from one body into another, and how it had
once also been transferred from the body of an ass into
that of a physician. In that capacity, the soul informed
the author that it had prospered greatly, not on account of
its cleverness or ability, but because it had acted on certain
practical rules which it recommended the author to follow
<span class="pageno target" title="132" id="page-132"></span>
in his profession. The soul then goes on to explain what
they are:—
</p>

<p>
“1. Powder your hair white, and place on the table of
your study a human skull and some curious skeletons of
the animal world. Those coming to you for medical advice
will then say that your hair must surely have turned white
through overwork in your profession, and through your
protracted studies in the domain of natural science.
</p>

<p>
“2. Fill your library with large-sized books that are richly
bound in red and gold. No matter whether you ever open
and read them or not, people will always have a high
opinion of your great acquirements and wisdom.
</p>

<p>
“3. Sell and pawn everything for the sake of having
a carriage of your own. Your patients may die right
and left through your errors of judgment, yet the fact of
having your carriage waiting outside their doors will shield
you from adverse criticism.
</p>

<p>
“4. If called to a patient you must pay less attention to
him and his malady than to those persons who are round
about him. On leaving the sick-room assume a grave face,
and say that the case is a very critical one. Should the
patient die then you will have hinted at his death; but if,
on the other hand, he gets well again, his relations and
friends will naturally attribute his recovery to your extraordinary
medical skill.
</p>

<p>
“5. Have as little as possible to do with the poor. For, as
they will only send for you in hopeless and desperate cases,
you will not gain any honour or reward by attending them.
Be therefore exceedingly reserved with them, and keep them
at a distance. Let them wait outside your house, and those
who pass by will look with amazement at the crowd patiently
waiting to obtain your services.
</p>

<p>
“6. Consider every medical practitioner as your natural
enemy, and speak always of him with the utmost disparagement.
If he happens to be young, then you must say that
he has not had sufficient experience, and can do no good;
and if he is old, you must declare that either his eyesight
<span class="pageno target" title="133" id="page-133"></span>
is bad, or that he is a little crazy, and is not fit to be trusted
in important cases.
</p>

<p>
“7. If asked to take part in a consultation with other
physicians, you will be acting wisely if you always loudly
protest against the previous treatment of the case by your
colleagues. Whatever the issue of the case may be, you
will always be on the safe side.”
</p>

<p>
In the same satire Erter speaks in by no means flattering
terms of his old enemy, the Chief Rabbi of Lemberg, to
whom he had already alluded in another satire, entitled
<span class="heb" title="meoznei mishkal" xml:lang="he">מאזני משקל</span>.
There he had
censured him for having published
a bulky commentary on the well-known code of
Jewish laws, called <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, under the title of
<span class="heb" title="yeshu'ot Ya'akov" xml:lang="he">ישועות יעקב</span>,
as being the work
of his own pen. But Erter
shows that the contribution of the learned divine was
limited to the title-page, while the rest of it was in reality
the work of other authors. Not satisfied with this revelation,
however, Erter seizes the opportunity offered to him in the
satire “Transmigration of the Soul” to refer again to the
soul of the same Rabbi, who had once caused him such great
trouble. This soul, says Erter, made him a full confession
of its origin, and declared that it had formerly belonged to
a mean, scurvy, and ill-tempered watchdog. Being too
dangerous an animal to be allowed to move freely about,
it had to be kept chained to its kennel. There it kept
straining at its chain, watching all the time for any passersby;
and when it saw some one coming it began to howl
and to bark violently, and incited all the dogs in the neighbourhood
to follow his example, resulting in a deafening
uproar. Woe to the person who came within its reach
without being provided with a long stick or some other
protective weapon. For the dog would attack him suddenly,
and cause him serious injuries. But, on the other hand, if
the stranger were well armed, the savage brute would, in
spite of its pretended courage, retreat at once and crouch
behind its kennel. This dog once swallowed a big bone,
in consequence of which it died an untimely death, but its
<span class="pageno target" title="134" id="page-134"></span>
soul continued its transmigration, and entered the body of
a human being. When the latter grew up and became
a man he still retained the nature and the characteristics
peculiar to the canine species, or rather to a cowardly
watchdog. Unfortunately he thought fit to choose the
Jewish ministry for his calling, and as ill-luck would have
it succeeded ultimately in obtaining the guardianship of
the souls of his flock. Far from following the golden path
of a true minister of the Jewish religion, who is in duty
bound to promote peace and harmony in his community,
he allowed himself to be guided by his canine instinct, and
hectored every one whom he disliked. He thundered forth
his indiscriminate anathemas against those persons who
wished to enter the portals of the temple of knowledge, and
induced his adherents to assist him in carrying out his
holy work. But, like his cowardly prototype, the watchdog,
he only inflicted mortal wounds on the helpless and
the unprotected, while he did not dare to harm the rich
and powerful, as well as influential members of his flock
who resisted him. When the Rabbinical tyrant died his
soul, says Erter, migrated into the body of a fox, and
thence, in due course, it again entered into the human
frame of a spiritual leader of the “Chassidim.”
</p>

<p>
The “Rebbe” swindle and the clever tricks of the whole
fraternity of these performers of supernatural wonders give
plenty of scope to Erter's satire, and he is never weary of
ridiculing them. In the satire under notice Erter gets hold
of the soul of such a “Rebbe,” and causes it to relate some
of the adventures through which it had passed during its
earthly career. Among other amusing stories it also gives
a description of a clever trick, by means of which its late
owner, the “Rebbe,” had extricated himself from an awkward
position, and shows how he had deceived his devotees
even at the time of his death.
</p>

<p>
“My own son,” says the soul of the departed ‘Rebbe,’
“was once ill, and my wife, his mother, came to me and
implored me to offer prayers to God that his life might be
<span class="pageno target" title="135" id="page-135"></span>
spared. ‘Be not afraid,’ I said to her, ‘the son of God's
favourite will not perish.’ Next day, and the day after,
my wife begged me again in the name of heaven and
earth to intercede on behalf of the poor sufferer whose
illness had meanwhile taken a turn for the worse. But
I answered, and said, ‘Compose yourself, you silly woman.
I have already assured you that my son shall not die.’
Later in the day my wife rushed into my room, bathed in
tears, and exclaiming, ‘Alas, the Lord has dealt very bitterly
with me, and has taken from me my beloved child. What
shall I do, and what shall my life be without him, the joy
of my existence?’ Now it so happened that several of my
devotees were present when I told my wife that her son
would <i>not</i> die, and again when she actually informed me of
his death. I was thus placed in an awkward predicament;
but soon a happy thought struck me, which helped me out
of my embarrassment. I pretended to be amazed at the
sad news, and exclaimed, ‘What? am I to believe that my
own son has died, and no information has reached me from
heaven? No! never. You may do with my son whatever
you like, but I cannot acknowledge his death till it has
been officially notified to me from the world of spirits.’
And when, in due course, the remains of my son were
carried away to their last resting-place, I did not tear my
garments according to the general custom, nor did I follow
the funeral procession, pretending all the time to be
unaware of the fact of my son's death. But after the lapse
of several days, when sitting one evening in the midst of
my adherents and devotees, explaining to them some
passages of the Bible in my own mysterious way, I suddenly
burst into tears. ‘Alas!’ I exclaimed, ‘now, just
now, I begin to believe in my son's death, for a heavenly
message has just informed me of the sorrowful event.’
Soon after, I began to mourn over my son's demise, and all
the people round about me looked on with amazement, and
believed in me and in my holiness more firmly and more
truly than they had ever done before.”
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="136" id="page-136"></span>
</div>

<p>
The soul then goes on to relate the circumstances which
caused its departure from the “Rebbe's” body.
</p>

<p>
“One evening,” it said, “which happened to be the eve of
the festival called Simchath Torah, the ‘Rebbe’ leaped and
danced, according to his usual custom, round the <i>Bimah</i>
(‘reading platform’) of his little synagogue, amidst the
acclamations of his devotees. As on many other occasions
he had then also drunk a good deal of intoxicating wine,
and felt exceedingly jolly. In that sportive mood he called
out: ‘Make room for all the saints of the Bible, who have
just come here to rejoice with me on this joyful festival.
Let me drink the health of Father Abraham and of the
other patriarchs, who accompany him.’ And amidst his
shouting and drinking he suddenly beheld a vision. It
seemed to him that the walls of the synagogue were
turning round and round, and, fearing lest he might fall to
the ground, and his condition be observed by the bystanders,
he quickly exclaimed: ‘Come ye, my spiritual
guests, Abraham, Isaac, and all the rest of you, and follow
me to my own room. There we will have a sacred meeting,
and discuss our secret affairs.’ Saying which, he staggered
into his own room, and locked and bolted the door behind
him.
</p>

<p>
“When the devotees saw this, they said to each other:
‘No one is like our Master; no one can be compared to
our holy “Rebbe”; he is a perfect saint, the Holy of holies
to the letter. How they all left paradise, those great and
exalted personages of the Bible, and have come to his place
of worship, in order to rejoice in his pleasant company.
Nay, before our very eyes has he spoken to them as a man
speaks to his friends, and amidst leaping and dancing has
he addressed them familiarly, and loudly toasted their
health. Now, they are all assembled in his room where
they are discussing certain matters concerning ourselves,
such as our final release from bondage, and our return to
Zion by the help of the Messiah. Our “Rebbe” will also
succeed in subduing the powers of the evil spirit, <i>Samael</i>,
<span class="pageno target" title="137" id="page-137"></span>
along with all the other legions of evil spirits; he will
tread him under his feet, and will thus prevent him from
doing us any harm.’
</p>

<p>
“While they were thus addressing each other, and their
minds were occupied with the discussion of the ‘Rebbe's’
doings, a boy rushed in breathlessly, and, in the greatest
consternation, told all those present that he had just seen
the body of the ‘Rebbe’ lying lifeless on the ground in
the yard of his house. Thereupon all the Chassidim ran
out woe-stricken and terrified, and behold, there, on a heap
of refuse, close to the window of the ‘Rebbe's’ room, lay
his corpse, the dead body of the great saint. At the sight
of which they began weeping and lamenting, and said:
‘Alas, on account of our own sins and transgressions of
the law that righteous man had died. The evil spirit
<i>Samael</i> has overpowered him, and has thrown him through
the window into the yard.’
</p>

<p>
“But the truth is—thus the soul concludes its narrative—that
he had no quarrel with Satan, nor any fight with the
rest of the evil spirits. The evil spirit that caused his
untimely death was of quite a different nature. It was the
spirit he had drunk that had cut short his existence. For,
after his heavy potations of the evening, the ‘Rebbe’ felt
rather ill. He opened the window of his room, and leant
out into the fresh air. No sooner had he done so than he
lost his balance, and fell headlong on the stones below. No
immediate help being near at hand he soon after expired.”
</p>

<p>
There are several other passages in Erter's writings which
treat the same subject equally humorously, but another
short extract from one of the satires, having for its title
“Piety and Wisdom,” will suffice. After having pointed
out in general terms the great advantages which the calling
of a “Rebbe” offers, the author takes the young aspirant
into his confidence, and describes its glorious prospects in
the following words:—
</p>

<p>
“When,” says he, “you are a holy man, you will have
a greater treasury than the king has, inasmuch as all the
<span class="pageno target" title="138" id="page-138"></span>
gold and silver belonging to your devotees, who may live in
your district, will be yours. Any king or ruler of a land,
who wishes to levy taxes from his loyal subjects, is obliged
to appoint and employ tax-collectors for that purpose, but
your adherents will place all their money and wealth at
your disposal without your asking for it. Should any one
of them fall ill, money will be sent to you to offer up prayers
for his recovery. You keep, at any rate, those monetary
presents, for if such patients die it will generally be assumed
that their death was a punishment for their previous evil
doings; but if they are restored again to life and health,
then that fact will be attributed to the efficacy of your
prayers. The same will be the case when people come to
you to obtain your advice in regard to business or matrimonial
matters. If they are successful, and everything
turns out to be according to their heart's desire, then it is
you and your great divine power that have effected all this;
but, on the other hand, if your counsel and foretelling lead
them astray, they will have to ascribe their failure to their
own follies and misdeeds.”
</p>

<p>
Erter succeeded in infusing a new life and spirit into the
Hebrew tongue, which is generally classed among the dead
languages. To quote the words that he himself uses on
behalf of the genius of the Hebrew language, “I am dead in
the mouths of my children, but I live still in their hearts.”
Erter did more than only protest against the lack of
originality in later Hebrew writers; he himself supplied the
deficiency. But he was no mere writer of Hebrew prose.
He had the welfare of his Jewish countrymen constantly at
heart, and it was with the object of improving their low
mental and social position that he wrote those satires, in
which their shortcomings and follies were censured and
ridiculed. He spared no class; Rabbi and layman alike
felt the sting of his scorn, and it was by this means that he
really did some good. For some time he also edited, in co-operation
with some friends, a Hebrew periodical under the
name of <i>He-Chaluz</i>
(<span class="heb" title="hechaluts" xml:lang="he">החלוץ</span>),
which continued to appear after
<span class="pageno target" title="139" id="page-139"></span>
his death. This journal was intended to promote the enlightenment
and learning of the Jews in Galicia, and
gradually to win their sympathies for his favourite project,
namely, the establishment of an agricultural colony in his
own country, in which Jewish young men should be employed
in tilling the ground, and in farming tracts of land
on their own account. This healthy and useful occupation,
he maintained, would help to decrease, to a great extent, the
misery and poverty, which are, even now, the characteristic
feature of that particular part of the Austrian empire. And
strange to say the very plan, which was drawn up so many
years ago by Erter without being carried into effect, has
quite recently been taken up again in the capital of Austria
by the most influential members of the Jewish community,
at the instigation of the late Baron Hirsch.
</p>

<p>
Erter's writings form but a slender volume, but it may
safely be said that they will outlive many a more pretentious
work. True humour is a rare possession, and
Erter's style will never cease to be a source of delight to
those who have a relish for keen satire, and for an elegant
and poetical employment of the language of the Bible.

<a href="#toc-return-XIII">LEOPOLD ZUNZ</a><a id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor"><sup>[140-1]</sup></a></span></h2>

<p>
<span class="begc">Among</span> the prominent Jewish scholars of the nineteenth
century Zunz will always occupy a high place. Like
Moses Mendelssohn in his time, Zunz, in a later generation,
carried on his spiritual work among his people with unceasing
energy and ability, though in a somewhat different
direction. While the former rendered a lasting service to
the Jews by arousing in their minds a love for secular
studies, Zunz conferred a no less important benefit upon
them by bringing to light a large mass of literary matter,
which was the result of his lifelong critical researches into
Jewish history and literature. In these two departments
Zunz was, in fact, a pioneer, and the works he published
in connexion with them have proved themselves to be of
considerable assistance to the student. The present essay
is mainly intended to give the reader some notion of the
contents of Zunz's most important writings, but it will
also contain a brief sketch of his life.
</p>

<p>
Leopold Zunz<a id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor"><sup>[140-2]</sup></a> was born at Detmold, in Germany, on
August 10, 1794 (15th of <i>Ab</i>, 5554). His early life was
passed at Hamburg, where his father had opened a Hebrew
school. There young Zunz received his first training, but
after the death of his father he was sent by his mother to
Samson's Free School at Wolfenbüttel, where his intelligence
attracted the attention of one of his teachers, Samuel
<span class="pageno target" title="141" id="page-141"></span>
Meyer Ehrenberg by name, who bestowed special care upon
him. Here it may be mentioned, in passing, that Jost,
the historian, was his schoolfellow, and that a close friendship
sprang up between them, which lasted both their
lives<a id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor"><sup>[141-1]</sup></a>.
</p>

<p>
In 1809, when only fifteen years old, Zunz was already
found capable of assisting in tuition at his own school,
but while teaching others he made use of all the available
time at his disposal to increase his own knowledge. He
attended for some years the Gymnasium at Wolfenbüttel,
and in 1815 he matriculated at the Berlin University, being
the first Jew admitted as a student to a Prussian university.
The principal studies he pursued there, were history,
philology, and mathematics. He frequented especially the
lectures of De Wette, F. A. Wolf, and Boeckh. He also
employed part of his time in reading books of modern
literature, and in 1817 he published a few pieces of light
prose and verse in some Berlin periodicals. From a
pecuniary point of view Zunz derived very little advantage
from these literary contributions, but they were nevertheless
useful to him, inasmuch as they made his name known
in some of the Berlin literary circles, and thus paved the
way for his subsequent appointment to the post of editor-in-chief
of the <i>Sperner'sche Zeitung</i> that appeared daily in
Berlin as a political paper.
</p>

<p>
It was fortunate for Zunz that, while at the university, he
still kept up his previous studies in Hebrew and Rabbinical
lore, for owing no doubt to the knowledge he possessed of
these subjects he was appointed, in 1820, the first German
preacher of the Reformed Synagogue at Berlin. This appointment,
however, he gave up voluntarily, after having
held it for two years; the reason for so doing is stated in the
preface to his <i>Collection of Sermons</i>, which he published at
<span class="pageno target" title="142" id="page-142"></span>
Berlin in 1823. It appears that Zunz, noticing the general
indifference of his congregation in religious matters, spoke
his mind pretty freely about it in the pulpit. His audiences
consequently diminished, and his position became intolerable.
He therefore resigned his office, but was lucky enough
after to find employment on the above-mentioned paper,
which enabled him to marry the lady of his choice. This
was Adelaide, <i>née</i> Berman, a relation of David Frankel,
Chief Rabbi of Berlin<a id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor"><sup>[142-1]</sup></a>.
</p>

<p>
In 1835 Zunz accepted the offer made by a section of
the Jewish community of Prague to become its preacher,
but, after a year's stay at Prague, he returned to Berlin,
where he was subsequently appointed Principal of the
Training College for Jewish teachers. When, in 1850,
this institution ceased to exist, Zunz retired into private
life, receiving, however, a small pension from the Berlin
community as an acknowledgment of the useful services
he had rendered to Judaism by his contributions to Jewish
science and literature. On this scanty income, sometimes
slightly increased by the profits of his books, Zunz and
his wife managed to live pretty comfortably, and even
occasionally to entertain their friends. Among the latter
may specially be mentioned Professor Gans, M. Jost,
Joseph Lehmann, M. Moser, Dr. Carrière, the Deputy
Warburg, and last, but not least, Heinrich Heine. Heine
seems to have been especially attached to them. He used
to read to them his poems in MS., some of them, which
bear a specific Jewish colouring, were very probably suggested
by his learned host<a id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor"><sup>[142-2]</sup></a>. In his visits to England,
France, and Italy, Zunz inspected many rare MSS., which
had been hidden away in various public and private
libraries, and likewise obtained fresh material for his
literary works.
</p>

<p>
Zunz always referred to his wife in the most affectionate
<span class="pageno target" title="143" id="page-143"></span>
terms, and in a letter addressed to a friend some time
before her death he said that for a period of forty-two
years she had been a most faithful helpmate to him,
sharing all his joys and sorrows, and encouraging him in
his work. Her death, which occurred on August 18, 1874,
caused Zunz the greatest sorrow, and from that moment
he became more and more melancholy, and was never
again in a fit state of mind to undertake any important
literary work. Yet he lived, though in strict retirement,
to celebrate his ninetieth birthday, on which occasion a
tribute of respect was paid to him by some of his friends
and admirers, which took the shape of a volume, entitled
<i>Jubelschrift zum 90<sup>sten</sup> Geburtstag des Dr. Leopold Zunz</i>.
It contained literary contributions from Steinschneider,
Neubauer, Jellinek, Güdemann, David Kaufmann, Derenbourg,
and other scholars. A few years later, viz. on
March 17, 1886, corresponding to the 11th of the Hebrew
month of <i>Adar</i>, Zunz died peacefully. Zunz's valuable
and interesting library was subsequently bought by the
Trustees of the Montefiore College Library at Ramsgate,
while his unpublished MSS. were taken possession of by the
Trustees of the so-called “Zunz-Stiftung,” founded at Berlin
in 1864 in commemoration of Zunz's seventieth birthday,
with the object of giving pecuniary assistance to Jewish
authors, and enabling them to publish such of their MSS.
as the authorities of the “Stiftung” considered fit.
</p>

<p>
Zunz's literary labours began at an early age. In 1818
he published an essay entitled <i>A Study in Rabbinical
Literature</i>, which is specially interesting on account of its
containing a definition of the various subjects that constitute
Jewish literature, to which, however, neither past
nor contemporary students had paid due attention. It
may at once be said that, though it was originally written
with the view of inducing scholars of his time to work
out the subjects mentioned therein, it was the author
himself who did the most in giving effect to his own
suggestions.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="144" id="page-144"></span>
</div>

<p>
In 1823 he published a sketch of the life and works of
the famous commentator on the Bible and the Talmud,
Rabbi Solomon Yizchaki, commonly called “Rashi” (1040–1105).
This essay may be said to be a model biographical
sketch. It contains almost all the ingredients which go
to compose an interesting and instructive whole. It is
characterized by method and the critical acumen, which is
generally sadly lacking in biographies written before his
time, and has indicated new lines of thought in more
directions than one.
</p>

<p>
A few years later, in 1830, Zunz's attention was drawn
to a book entitled <i>Théorie du Judaïsme</i>, which a French
priest, Chiarini by name, had published at Paris, in which
he inimically discussed the Talmud and Rabbinical literature
generally. Being himself unable to read the Rabbinical
writings in the original, Chiarini contented himself
with the repetition of almost all the adverse criticisms
which had appeared in the writings of Buxtorf, Bartolocci,
Eisenmenger, and others. At the time of the publication
of this book Zunz was collecting materials for his intended
great work <i>Homilies of the Jews</i>, but he found time to
write and issue a small pamphlet under the title of
<i>Beleuchtung der “Théorie du Judaïsme” des Abbé Chiarini</i>
(Berlin, 1830), pointing out therein some of the more flagrant
inaccuracies and plagiarisms of Chiarini's book.
</p>

<p>
But Zunz did not belong to that class of critical reviewers
who, though quick in detecting the faults of others,
cannot show that they themselves would have done much
better in the same field of work. For two years after the
issue of Chiarini's book (in 1832) he published a work
which showed at once the master-mind of a first-rate
scholar, and gained for its author an enduring fame. This
work was entitled <i>Die gottesdienstlichen Vorträge der
Juden</i> (“Homilies of the Jews”). There the author gives
a description of the evolution of culture among the Jews
extending over more than two thousand years. Beginning
with a general survey of the great moral influence, which
<span class="pageno target" title="145" id="page-145"></span>
the teachings of the Bible had exercised on the mind of
the Jewish people, the author goes on to define Jewish
tradition, and to describe its progress and its development.
The reader thus becomes acquainted with the history of
the genesis of the Mishna, the Talmud, and the Midrash,
and likewise with the form of prayers and sermons that
prevailed at different times among the Jews. Speaking
of sermons Zunz shows in his <i>Gottesdienstliche Vorträge</i>
that preaching has at all times formed an important part
of the synagogue service, and that, during the eighteenth
century, sermons were even delivered in the vernacular in
several Jewish places of worship belonging to Portuguese
congregations. Zunz's special object was to show the injustice
of the decree of the Prussian government, which
forbade preaching in synagogues, on the plea that it was
an exclusively Christian institution. This he contended
was not historically correct, as long before the dawn of
Christianity the use of homilies in synagogues was
common, and ought, therefore, not to be interfered with
in modern times. Thus it will be seen that Zunz had
a double object in view in this book. In the first place,
he desired to point out to his own people the vast amount
of interesting and valuable material to be extracted from
the wide field of Jewish literature; and, in the second,
he wished to afford the outer world an insight into the
intellectual life of the Jews of past ages. They were then,
according to the evidence adduced by Zunz, much more
civilized and cultured than their unscrupulous enemies
declared them to be, and they had, therefore, a good right
to claim in the country of their birth perfect equality in
the eyes of the law.
</p>

<p>
Zunz's second great work, entitled <i>Beiträge zur Geschichte
und Literatur</i>, was published in 1845. It contains a
number of essays on diverse Jewish subjects, which are
full of interest. In the preface to this work the author
makes the following noteworthy remarks: “Jewish literature
plays an important part in the general culture of the
<span class="pageno target" title="146" id="page-146"></span>
nations of antiquity, and is also closely connected with
the origin and the gradual development of Christianity at
large. It has likewise exercised a marked influence on
past and present generations, and participating, as it did,
in their common struggles and sufferings, it has become, as
it were, a supplement to the entire literature of the world.
And indeed, if mental activity generally may be compared
to a vast and boundless sea, then Jewish literature deserves
to be designated as one of the streams which flowed into it
and helped it to a wider expansion.”
</p>

<p>
Though, as already stated, the contents of the <i>Beiträge</i>
are of a varied description, they deal chiefly with that
section of Jewish literature that owes its existence to the
Jewish writers of the Middle Ages. Mention is made of
a good many mediaeval Jewish commentators on the Bible
and the Talmud, as well as of grammarians and moralists.
Instructive remarks are made on some of them, most of
whose names and writings had scarcely been known before.
Here our admiration for Zunz's rare talents must be enhanced
when it is observed how out of stray paragraphs
and notes found in old and neglected MSS., in rare prints,
or on almost illegible tombstones, he has actually created
a standard book of reference, which has now become indispensable
to every student of Jewish literature.
</p>

<p>
In the course of his investigations in the <i>Beiträge</i> Zunz
touches on a subject which ought not to be passed over
unnoticed. He refers to the crass ignorance sometimes
manifested by Christian scholars in regard to Judaism and
its literature. He quotes, for example, the names of a few
French writers, who had published books dealing with
Jewish subjects, of which they knew as little as the aforementioned
Chiarini. One of them, Cupefigne by name,
actually won the prize offered by the French Academy for
the best essay on the subject, <i>L'État littéraire des Juifs
dans le moyen âge</i>. But as a specimen of what he actually
knew of the Talmud Zunz quotes the following note he
found in the essay. It runs thus: <i>Le Gemare titre Sanhed.</i>
<span class="pageno target" title="147" id="page-147"></span>
<i>Sectio 14; le Talmud même titre</i>. With this kind of
Talmudical knowledge says Zunz, with just indignation,
a French professor has ventured to write a long dissertation
on Rabbinical literature, for which he was rewarded by the
most learned literary society in France with a valuable
prize<a id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor"><sup>[147-1]</sup></a>.
</p>

<p>
Another masterpiece of Zunz, ranking almost as high as
his <i>Homilies of the Jews</i>, is <i>Die synagogale Poesie</i>, which
deals specially with the <i>Piyutim</i> and <i>Selichoth</i>, and
which was published in 1855. It is virtually only the
first volume of a work, which would certainly have remained
incomplete without the two additional volumes,
issued in 1859 and 1865 under the respective titles <i>Die
Ritus des synagogalen Gottesdienstes</i> and <i>Nachtrag zur
Literaturgeschichte der synagogalen Poesie</i>. Each of these
volumes treats of a variety of subjects, though they all
belong to one and the same department.
</p>

<p>
Though the literary matter contained and discussed in
<i>Die synagogale Poesie</i> is extremely copious and interesting,
it is impossible to do more, within the limits of a short
essay, than to refer to it briefly. Beginning with the
Psalms the author describes the process of the gradual
development of psalmody into the so-called <i>Agadah</i>, and
that of the latter into the various kinds of prayers usually
read in the synagogue, including the “Penitential Poems,”
called <i>Selichoth</i>. These, containing, as they do, some of the
most heartrending incidents in the mediaeval history of
the Jews, Zunz discusses with special warmth and feeling.
One particular passage excited the admiration of George
Eliot, who printed a translation of it in <i>Daniel Deronda</i>.
It runs as follows:—
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="148" id="page-148"></span>
</div>

<p>
“If there are ranks in suffering, Israel takes precedence
of all the Nations;—if the duration of sorrows, and the
patience with which they are borne, ennoble, the Jews are
among the aristocracy of every land;—if a literature is
called rich in the possession of a few classical tragedies,
what shall we say to a national Tragedy lasting for fifteen
hundred years, in which the poets and actors were also the
heroes.”
</p>

<p>
When some later writers, including Professor Paul Legarde,
criticized the <i>Synagogale Poesie</i> adversely, asserting
that Zunz had wasted his time and energy in the preparation
of an elaborate work on the <i>Piyutim</i>, most of which
are admittedly valueless, the late Professor David Kaufmann
defended his friend, the author, in a remarkable pamphlet.
He says, <i>inter alia</i>, that in writing about the <i>Piyutim</i>
Zunz was chiefly actuated by the desire to display before
the eyes of the world the unexampled miseries and sufferings,
which the Jewish people endured during a period
extending over more than a thousand years. Thus it was
obvious that, whether the <i>Piyutim</i> have by their existence
enriched Hebrew literature or not, Zunz has, at all events,
by his long dissertation on them, brought to light a piece
of history of his people which, for various reasons, was
worthy of a permanent record.
</p>

<p>
Another noteworthy point connected with the <i>Synagogale
Poesie</i> is, that it contains a considerable number of versified
German translations of pieces of liturgical Hebrew poetry,
which renders them more intelligible to the ordinary reader
than would otherwise have been the case. The following
example may serve here as an illustration. One of the
dullest liturgical pieces composed by the Hebrew writer
Kaliri (about 700 <span class="bc">A. D.</span>) is no doubt the Hebrew hymn
beginning with the words, <i>Adam-u-behemah</i>
(<span class="heb" title="adam ubehemah" xml:lang="he">אדם ובהמה</span>),
which is read in most of the synagogues on <i>Hoshanah
Rabbah</i>. Yet Zunz translated it into excellent German.
A free English translation is appended:—
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="149" id="page-149"></span>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">On all that lives and moves</p>
    <p class="verse">Look down, O Lord, with grace;</p>
    <p class="verse">Preserve in health and strength</p>
    <p class="verse">The feeble human race.</p>
    <p class="verse">Oh, let the earth again</p>
    <p class="verse">In spring-like aspect shine,</p>
    <p class="verse">Producing lovely flowers,</p>
    <p class="verse">Delicious figs and vine.</p>
    <p class="verse">Let rain bedew the fields,</p>
    <p class="verse">The mountains high and low,</p>
    <p class="verse">That plants, and herbs, and trees</p>
    <p class="verse">Luxuriously grow.</p>
    <p class="verse">Arouse anew to life</p>
    <p class="verse">All that abides on earth,</p>
    <p class="verse">And let our hearts rejoice</p>
    <p class="verse">In lively songs and mirth.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
It may be mentioned here, in passing, that some of Zunz's
poetical German translations are in style and form hardly
inferior to the specimen renderings of Eastern poetry found
in the works of Goethe, Herder, Rückert, and Bodenstedt.
In fact, it is not too much to say that Zunz's German poetry
and prose are classical. His style is praised by Varnhagen
von Ense, who describes it in his <i>Diary</i> as being in many
places most elegant and attractive.
</p>

<p>
As already stated, it was in 1859 that Zunz published an
additional volume to the <i>Synagogale Poesie</i>, called <i>Die
Ritus des synagogalen Gottesdienstes</i>, which mostly consists
of inquiries into synagogal rites. He alludes to the varied
rites that had been in vogue among Jews living in different
countries, and he points out certain customs adopted by the
synagogue which had their origin in the Christian Church.
To these, he says, belong the customs of making monetary
offerings in the synagogue during the reading of the Law,
which had, however, long been in use in the Gallic Church.
There, in return for such offerings, the officiating priest
was wont to read a prayer, called in Latin <i>Oratio post
nomina</i>. This prayer corresponds, according to Zunz, to
the one still recited in some synagogues by the precentor on
mentioning the offerings made by the person “called-up”
<span class="pageno target" title="150" id="page-150"></span>
to the reading of the Law, which is well known by the
name of <i>Mi-Sheberach</i>
(<span class="heb" title="mi sheberach" xml:lang="he">מי שברך</span>).
Zunz also thinks that
the usage practised in the synagogue of reciting prayers
in memory of the souls of departed parents and near
relations, likewise originated in the Christian Church, as
mention is made of it in the early Christian liturgy.
</p>

<p>
The third volume forming part of the <i>Synagogale Poesie</i> was,
as already stated, published by Zunz in 1865 under the title
of <i>Die Literaturgeschichte der synagogalen Poesie</i>. Though
a small supplement was added to it about two years later
under the heading of <i>Nachträge zur Literaturgeschichte der
synagogalen Poesie</i>, it virtually closed the series of Zunz's
three epoch-making works that deal almost exhaustively
with the most important branches of Jewish science and
literature. In this particular field of study and research,
Zunz proved himself to be a first-rate critic and investigator,
and there he also attained conspicuous success. But, while
admiring in Zunz his many-sided talents, and more especially
his extensive knowledge of earlier and later Hebrew literature,
credit must also be given him for the honesty with which
he records the obligations he owed to his literary friends
for their aid in the preparations of his literary compositions.
Among them may be specially mentioned Delitzsch,
Rapoport, Luzzatto, Sachs, and Dukes, with all of whom
Zunz for many years carried on a lively correspondence.
This helped him greatly in his researches. Thus, for
instance, in 1832, Zunz was only aware of the existence of
200 <i>Selichoth</i>, but from the information supplied by his
friends he was enabled to add to the list of these liturgical
poems until they had reached the large number of 1,816.
</p>

<p>
It is natural that Zunz had many admirers among men
of education, who were able to read and appreciate his
German works. Yet it is interesting to note that a great
many Jews, who were only slightly acquainted with
German, but had an extensive knowledge of Hebrew and the
Talmud, held him in great esteem as a Hebrew scholar.
This distinction Zunz owed to his mastery over the Hebrew
<span class="pageno target" title="151" id="page-151"></span>
style, examples of which are to be found in the preface
to his edition of Krochmal's <i>Morè Nebuche Ha-Z'man</i>
(<span class="heb" title="morè nevochè hazman" xml:lang="he">מורה נבוכי הזמן</span>),
and likewise in the Hebrew periodical
<i>Kerem Chemed</i>. The latter contains a biographical sketch
of the famous Jewish critic, Azariah de Rossi (1514–98),
which is not only remarkable for its learning, but also for
the excellence of its composition. Zunz also wrote some
pretty Hebrew verses, specimens of which he gave in his
metric Hebrew translation of Klopstock's <i>Die Sommernacht</i>,
which appeared (in 1819) in Heinemann's Annual, called
<i>Yedidja</i>.
</p>

<p>
It is to be regretted that Zunz, when at the height of his
fame, and already advanced in years, thought fit to write
an essay published in the <i>Zeitschrift der deutsch-morgenländischen
Gesellschaft</i>, vol. XXVII, pp. 669–89, embodying
the views of Biblical criticism of the advanced school.
There he tries to prove, for instance, that Leviticus and
certain parts of Deuteronomy were composed at a much
later date than tradition has assigned to them, and that
the Day of Atonement and the festivals of New Year and
Purim were unknown to the early composers of the
Pentateuch. These views naturally aroused the anger of
all strictly orthodox Jews, and they also brought him in
conflict with his ultra-radical friend Geiger, who censured
him for his obvious inconsistency, because in another essay
(published in the second part of his <i>Gesammelte Schriften</i>)
Zunz spoke of the practice of wearing phylacteries as a
noble and sacred institution which ought to be rigorously
observed, while here he questioned the sanctity of the
holiest day in the Jewish calendar. But, though Zunz
subsequently defended his apparently antagonistic views to
the accepted traditions of the Jews, it would certainly have
been better for his reputation had he left Biblical criticism
alone.
</p>

<p>
Zunz was undoubtedly filled with a deep love for his
people. By his labours he showed to the world that the
Jews had, like other nations, a history, a science, a philosophy,
<span class="pageno target" title="152" id="page-152"></span>
and a remarkable literature, on the strength of which
they were entitled to claim equal rights and privileges
with their fellow men in all that concerned their intellectual,
social, and political life. In this point his aims and ideals
were somewhat akin to those of his great prototype and
predecessor Moses Mendelssohn. In fact, they had much
in common both in respect of their life and their character.
Both being of humble origin, they had both at the outset
of their scholastic career to contend with poverty and want.
They were both deeply attached to their people, and did
what in them lay to remove their disabilities, and especially
to encourage them in the correct use of their native tongue.
It is true that in religious matters neither of them exercised
a favourable influence on his surroundings. But this at
least will be universally admitted that the admiration
entertained by Heine for Hebrew literature was chiefly due
to his long and friendly intercourse with Zunz, which no
doubt gave rise to those laudatory expressions found in
his <i>Perlen des Romancero</i>, his <i>Rabbi von Bacharach</i>, and
more especially in his book entitled <i>Heine über Börne</i>.
</p>

<p>
Was Zunz ever really happy? This question, if raised,
could hardly be answered affirmatively. Long before and
after his marriage he experienced constant disappointments;
and as for the state of his mind subsequent to the death of
his wife—who, by the way, left him childless—we learn from
the correspondence he then carried on with Professor David
Kaufmann, how completely overcome he was. The fact is,
that Zunz fancied that he and his works were not sufficiently
known to, and appreciated by, his co-religionists and the
literary fraternity of the day, and on this account he once
sent to Kaufmann the following characteristic lines:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Bist du mit Grafen nicht verwandt,</p>
    <p class="verse">Und Börsenrittern unbekannt—</p>
    <p class="verse">Du wirst—sei immerhin ein <i>Kant</i>—</p>
    <p class="verse">Von Zeitungsschreibern nie genannt.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
On another occasion, when writing to him, Zunz complains
of the indifference manifested towards him and his
<span class="pageno target" title="153" id="page-153"></span>
works by the Jews, and with bitter irony he goes on to say
that they would no doubt have established an annual fast-day
in his memory had he been the Gedaliah of the Bible,
a governor of a Jewish province, and murdered by an
assassin's hand<a id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor"><sup>[153-1]</sup></a>.
</p>

<p>
Zunz considered himself, and more especially in his
declining years, a disappointed man; but if the extent of
a man's happiness is to be measured by the amount of useful
work he has done for the benefit of others, then Zunz
deserves more to be envied than to be pitied. He has
certainly not lived and laboured, as he himself fancied, in
vain. He will always occupy a foremost place in the
annals of Jewish history and scholarship, and will ever be
honoured as the Nestor of Jewish science and literature.

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
<span class="begc">The</span> nineteenth century is remarkable in the annals of
Jewish history and bibliography on account of the many
eminent Jewish scholars it has produced, men who greatly
enlarged the field of what is known in modern phrase as
the science of Judaism. They threw new light on diverse
Jewish subjects of much importance, such as the Mishna,
the Talmud, the Midrash, and likewise on general Jewish
history and literature. Especially notable were Zunz,
Rapoport, Geiger, Munk, Jost, Fürst, Jellinek, Luzzatto,
and Frankel.
</p>

<p>
The two last-named savants form the subject of the
present essay, and are here treated together, not merely
because the centenary of their birth was some time ago
celebrated in several Jewish communities within the same
year, but because they were the renowned heads of two
Rabbinical colleges, which brought about a revival of
Talmudical and general Jewish studies.
</p>

<p>
Samuel David Luzzatto was born at Trieste, in Austria, in
August, 1800. He belonged to an old Italian Jewish family,
several members of which occupied conspicuous places in the
annals of Jewish history and scholarship. The most noted
among them were Moses Hayim Luzzatto (1707–40), the well-known
author of two delightful Hebrew dramas, entitled <i>La-Yesharim
Téhilla</i> and <i>Migdal Oz</i>, and Ephraïm Luzzatto,
who (in 1768) published in London a collection of charming
little Hebrew poems and songs<a id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor"><sup>[154-1]</sup></a>, which is spoken of in
eulogistic terms by Franz Delitzsch, in his <i>Geschichte der</i>
<span class="pageno target" title="155" id="page-155"></span>
<i>jüdischen Poesie</i>. Samuel D. Luzzatto received his early
education at the excellent Jewish Free School of his native
town, where he studied Biblical and Talmudical subjects,
general science, and ancient and modern languages. On
leaving school, Luzzatto chose literature as his future
calling, and with that purpose in view he applied himself
with the utmost zeal to the study of the Italian language
and literature, which he in later years knew almost to
perfection. At the age of nineteen he became, by mere
chance, known throughout the whole of Italy as a talented
writer of Italian verses. It so happened that the then
Austrian Crown Prince, who subsequently became Emperor
of Austria, paid a flying visit to Trieste, and that the leaders
of the local Jewish community commissioned young Luzzatto
to write an Italian sonnet in commemoration of the royal
visit. The Prince expressed his appreciation of its excellence
by causing it to be published in several leading papers of
the country.
</p>

<p>
But a far more substantial recognition of his attainments
was accorded to Luzzatto a few years later in the shape of
a professorship at the Collegio Rabbinico, which, at the
instigation of the Austrian government, had been established
at Padua in the year 1829. A little before this Luzzatto
had married the daughter of one of his former masters, and
having just finished his first important literary work on
<i>Targum Onkelos</i>, called <i>Oheb Ger</i>, he bestowed upon his
firstborn son the name of “Philoxenes,” which was a literal
translation of the title of his book. The book was not
printed for some time, as the only publisher who was
willing to produce it, made the curious stipulation that the
author should bind himself to buy 200 copies of his own
work! This was the <i>honorarium</i> offered at the beginning
of last century to a Jewish scholar for an epoch-making
work. Undaunted by this discouragement Luzzatto continued
his literary occupation, and the fruits of his labours
ultimately appeared in print, partly during his lifetime and
partly after his death. They dealt with a great variety of
<span class="pageno target" title="156" id="page-156"></span>
subjects, more especially with Biblical exegesis, homiletics,
Jewish history, philosophy, and poetry. Poetry was one
of Luzzatto's favourite subjects, and he enriched it with
many valuable contributions of his own, which mostly
appeared in his two volumes entitled <i>Kinnor Naïm</i>
(<span class="heb" title="kinor naim" xml:lang="he">כנור נעים</span>).
To Luzzatto
credit is also due for having unearthed
a great number of Hebrew MSS. containing poems and
songs, which had Ibn Gabirol, Jehuda Halevi, the two Ibn
Ezras, and other famous Hebrew writers of the Middle
Ages for their authors. Luzzatto devoted a great deal of
his time and attention to editing them, although he knew
very well from past experiences that work of this kind was
a labour of love only, and nothing more. He was always
most willing to assist, in a literary sense, any one who
asked him for the loan of a copy of a rare Hebrew MS.,
which he happened to possess, and would himself very often
copy it out with his own hands. Writing to Luzzatto,
Zunz once reproached him for his generosity to unknown
persons, who often took advantage of his kindness and
abused it. In his reply to Zunz he said: “It lies in my
nature to act in literary matters just as I do. If to-day
Satan himself were to come to me and ask for a MS., which
he wished to have printed in Hades, I would kiss his hands
and cheerfully comply with his request. For surely I do
not work for my own benefit, nor for any ambitious purpose
of my own.”
</p>

<p>
For many years Luzzatto carried on a correspondence with
some of the most renowned savants of his time, such as Rapoport,
Zunz, Steinschneider, the Christian professors Delitzsch,
Rosenmüller, and Martinet, in addition to whom might also
be mentioned Geiger, Sachs, Dukes, Jellinek, Fürst, Kirchheim,
Reggio, and Ghirondi. They all profited more or less
from the literary contents of his letters, which they
frequently utilized in their own work. Luzzatto wrote
Hebrew, Aramaic, Latin, French, and German with a certain
amount of ease and fluency, but he was a master of Italian
prose and verse. A renowned Italian poetess, Eugenia
<span class="pageno target" title="157" id="page-157"></span>
Pavia Gentilomo by name, thought so much of his taste
that she always submitted her poems in MS. to him before
she sent them to the press for publication.
</p>

<p>
Though Luzzatto's general correspondence was large the
bulk of it was with Rapoport and Geiger. It is a well-known
fact that Geiger was greatly helped by Luzzatto in
the preparation of his excellent German version of Jehuda
Halevi's Hebrew poems and songs. On one occasion, when
Geiger delayed in answering a long letter of Luzzatto's, the
latter reminded him of his omission in a poem consisting
of four stanzas, each of which was composed in another
language. One stanza, written in French, is worth reproducing:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Monsieur le Grand-Rabbin, Abraham Violoniste<a id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor"><sup>[157-1]</sup></a></p>
    <p class="verse">Avez-vous tout d'un coup cassé le violon?</p>
    <p class="verse">Ne donne-t-elle plus votre main le doux son,</p>
    <p class="verse">L'aimable mélodie, ranimant l'esprit triste?</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
Equally interesting is a German poem by Geiger to
Luzzatto, accompanying a copy of Jehuda Halevi's works,
in which he gratefully acknowledges his many obligations
to Luzzatto. It runs as follows:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Aus frommer Dichter Stamm, selbst frommer Dichter,</p>
    <p class="verse">Ein Weiser, Edler, mild zugleich als Richter,</p>
    <p class="verse">Ein Nil, der überströmend Segen spendet,</p>
    <p class="verse">Doch Deines Wissensfluth nicht Schlamm aussendet.</p>
    <p class="verse">Hast meine Fluren auch getränket,</p>
    <p class="verse">Dort edle Reben eingesenket.</p>
    <p class="verse">Die Frucht ist reif, lass sie Dir reichen,</p>
    <p class="verse">Nimm sie als treuer Freundschaft Zeichen.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
In spite of his multifarious literary occupations Luzzatto
devoted particular care and attention to his professorial
duties in the Collegio Rabbinico. It was his ambition to
make it a model for all Rabbinical colleges. His disciples,
consisting as they did of Italians, Germans, Poles, and
Russians, loved and revered their master, who, in his turn,
treated them as if they were his personal friends, and took
<span class="pageno target" title="158" id="page-158"></span>
the liveliest interest in their affairs. He took a special
pride in noting in his own works any clever idea suggested
by his pupils in the course of his lectures, and he thus
encouraged them to literary enterprise on their own
account. If the question were asked what the leading
feature of Luzzatto's character was, it might unhesitatingly
be answered that it was conscientiousness. When it
is remembered how he had to struggle against absolute
poverty for many years, and how frequently his home was
visited by sickness and death, his whole-hearted devotion
to his duties, his enthusiasm in his literary pursuits, and his
universal kindness become intensified. It was this conscientiousness
which led him to decline the post of <i>Haham</i>
to the Spanish and Portuguese congregation in London,
because he thought that he could not acquire sufficient
mastery over the English language to enable him to preach
in it satisfactorily.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to note that Luzzatto's literary activity
continued almost till his death. His very last literary
production was a Hebrew sonnet composed in commemoration
of the sixth centenary of the birth of Dante. Luzzatto
died after a short illness, on the eve of the Day of Atonement,
in 1865.
</p>

<p>
The limits of an essay do not permit of entering on any
detailed account of Luzzatto's multifarious books and
treatises. Suffice it to say that, if put together, they would
occupy a large space in a small library. It is, however,
not the quantity but rather the quality of his writings that
commands our close attention. This is specially the case
with those which deal with the exposition of the Bible.
To this particular branch of study Luzzatto devoted much
time, and to his credit it must be said that he was one of
the first Jewish scholars of the nineteenth century who
took it up seriously and with conspicuous success.
</p>

<p>
It would be idle to ignore altogether Luzzatto's faults
and inconsistencies, which resulted in a rupture with some
of his best friends. As an instance may be mentioned his
<span class="pageno target" title="159" id="page-159"></span>
quarrels with Rapoport, Geiger, and some other friends.
Again, he sometimes expressed the most radical views
concerning the <i>Massorah</i>, and, on the other hand, attacked
the works of Maimonides and Ibn Ezra on account of their
liberal ideas in the exposition of certain Biblical subjects.
But, in spite of all this, we cannot and must not diminish our
admiration for a man like Luzzatto, whose self-sacrificing
efforts were always directed towards the advancement of
the interest of Jewish literature generally.

<p class="subtitle2">
ZACHARIAH FRANKEL</p>

<p>
In the first part of this essay reference was made to the
similarity between Luzzatto and Frankel in respect of their
mental training, their vocation, and the first success, which
they both achieved therein. It is now proposed to give
a short sketch of Frankel's life, from which it will be seen
that he, like Luzzatto, was ever animated by the noble
desire of promoting the interests of Judaism, and its ancient
and modern literature.
</p>

<p>
Zachariah Frankel was born at Prague, in Austria, on
October 1, 1801, corresponding to the 24th of <i>Tishri</i>,
5562. He was the son of well-to-do parents, both of
whom belonged to ancient Jewish families, and some of
whose members had successively held the honourable post
of Chief Rabbi there. Young Frankel received his early
education in Prague. He studied Biblical and Talmudical
subjects, but also devoted part of his time to mathematics,
French, Latin, and Greek. At the age of twenty-three he
went to Buda-Pesth, at the university of which town he
continued his former studies, and there in due course he graduated
as Doctor of Philosophy. Being already well known
as a Talmudical scholar and as master of Jewish literature,
and having, moreover, obtained the authorization to act in
the capacity of Rabbi, Frankel was soon elected (in 1831)
the spiritual head of the Jewish community of Teplitz, in
<span class="pageno target" title="160" id="page-160"></span>
Bohemia. After staying there for four years, during which
time he introduced into the ritual the German sermon,
which, by the way, was then quite an innovation in
Austria, he was appointed Chief Rabbi of Saxony, having
his domicile at Dresden. There a wide field of activity
was at once opened for him, and he was not slow in showing
his great abilities. He soon proved himself to be not only
an eminent scholar and earnest writer and preacher, but
also a man of singularly vigorous action in communal
matters. It was chiefly due to his untiring and strenuous
efforts that some of the civil disabilities, under which the
Jews of Saxony then laboured, were removed by the government.
To this category belongs the ancient form of oath,
which used to be administered to them <i>more Judaico</i>.
</p>

<p>
While at Dresden, Frankel was offered the important
post of Chief Rabbi of Berlin, which he, however, declined;
but he consented to undertake the duties of organizer and
Director of the Jüdisch-theologisches Seminar (Jewish
Theological College), which was then about to be established
at Breslau, and has subsequently become famous as a model
institution of its kind. It was a post after his own heart.
He cherished the hope that in his capacity as leader and
teacher of numerous disciples, who would themselves one
day be leaders in the synagogue, he would be able to serve
the cause of Judaism better than if he were always to remain
the spiritual head of one single community. Frankel lived
to see the realization of his wishes; for a great many of
his pupils occupied more or less important positions as
Rabbis and preachers in different parts of the world, and
some of them worked as professors in institutions that were
almost identical in position and organization with the one
over which he himself presided.
</p>

<p>
When the Breslau Seminary was opened (on August 10,
1854), there were two conflicting currents of thought prevailing
in respect of Jewish law and custom. The Ultra-orthodox
party advocated a <i>noli me tangere</i> policy in
religious matters, and considered that any attempt towards
<span class="pageno target" title="161" id="page-161"></span>
the modification of any antiquated usage was levelled at
the whole structure of Judaism. The opposite party, of
whom there were many representatives in Germany and
elsewhere, were in favour of such radical changes in the
ritual as were calculated to create a positive revolution.
In these circumstances Frankel recommended his pupils
the adoption of a middle course in their future careers,
showing that, while he tacitly admitted the necessity
of some reform in Judaism, as it then existed, he was of
opinion that the changes should be introduced gradually
and with the utmost caution. He had already expressed
these views publicly, notably at the assembly of Rabbis at
Frankfort, and it is therefore obvious that he was not
averse to moderate religious reforms.
</p>

<p>
Although at the time of the opening of the Breslau Seminary
Frankel numbered among his colleagues such eminent
scholars as Graetz, Bernays, Joel, and Zuckermann, he himself
was and always remained the head, in fact as well as
name. His lectures were chiefly on the Talmud, the importance
and value of which he continually endeavoured to make
clear to his pupils. He read and explained to them certain
sections of it on each of the first five days of the week, and
in so doing he made a somewhat free use of the mode of
teaching that had been in vogue in the ancient Jewish
academies. He allowed and even encouraged his pupils to
enter upon discussions on the subject-matter of his lecture.
By this means Frankel was able to test the industry and
talent of each individual pupil. Once a week, however, he
gave a regular lecture in the classroom, at which there
was no discussion. On these occasions he generally discoursed
on the origin and development of the oral law,
extending over a period of several centuries. These lectures
were subsequently embodied in his book entitled <i>Darkè
Hammishnah</i>, to which special reference will presently be
made.
</p>

<p>
There is no doubt that Frankel was greatly in favour of
a free and unrestricted investigation of Judaism and its
<span class="pageno target" title="162" id="page-162"></span>
teachings, and that he always essayed to reconcile them
with what is called in modern phrase “der Zeitgeist.” Instances
of this are to be found everywhere in his writings
and treatises, many of which appeared in the monthly
magazine <i>Die Monatsschrift für Geschichte und Wissenschaft
des Judenthums</i>, which he edited from 1852 till
1868. As regards Frankel's books it may justly be said
that they are classical, but want of space precludes a reference
to more than three of them, which appear to be of
special interest.
</p>

<p>
Frankel's first important volume appeared at Leipsic in
1841, under the title of <i>Die Vorstudien zu der Septuaginta</i>
(“Studies in the Septuagint”). Several other writers,
including the renowned Jewish critic Azarya de Rossi
(1514–78), had already devoted their earnest attention
thereto, but none of them attained the same measure of
success as the author of the <i>Vorstudien</i>. Frankel throws
much light on the genesis, the composition, and the tendency
of the Septuagint, and explains the reason why its appearance
was hailed with delight by the Alexandrian Jews, but
condemned by that section of the Jews which then resided
in Palestine. Equally instructive and interesting are the
remarks he makes on the influence which it exercised on
several of the subsequent ancient translations of the Bible,
and on the development of the so-called <i>Halacha</i>. But, he
says, it has done much more than that. It has infused for
the first time into the thoughts and language of the civilized
nations of antiquity the lofty teachings of Judaism, and has
directly and indirectly enriched the world of letters with
many suggestive ethical and moral lessons. By the publication
of this particular book Frankel accomplished two
important things: in the first place he showed the world
that the Jews, as the authors of the Septuagint, have contributed
a great deal to universal literature; and then he
also made his own people acquainted with some of the
precious literary treasures which they possessed, but which
they had hitherto ignored.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="163" id="page-163"></span>
</div>

<p>
His second important work, published at Leipsic in 1859,
is entitled <i>Darkè Hammishnah</i>, but it has also the following
additional heading in Latin <i>Hodogetica in Mishnam
librosque cum ea conjunctos, Tosefta, Mechilta, Sifra, Sifri</i>.
It is written in an easy Hebrew style, which the author no
doubt rightly thought would be thoroughly understood by
all students of Rabbinical literature, as were not well
versed in any other language. This volume contains, as its
two titles already briefly indicate, much information on the
ancient Rabbinical lore and tradition generally, but chiefly
in respect of the Mishna. The latter is fully described
there with regard to its many authors, its varied characteristics,
its idiom, and its literary and scientific value.
It seems scarcely credible, but it is a fact that this important
and highly instructive work was at the time of its
appearance vehemently assailed by some ultra-orthodox
German and Austrian Rabbis, who publicly declared it to
be a dangerous book, and one calculated to undermine the
very foundations of Jewish law and tradition. On the
other hand it is gratifying to note that Rapoport at once
recognized its great merits, and did his best to defend it.
</p>

<p>
Frankel's third and last work was his <i>M'bo Ha-Yerushalmi</i>,
which means “An Introduction to the Jerusalem Talmud.”
Like the <i>Darkè Hammishnah</i> it was written in Hebrew, and
was published in 1870, that is to say, when the author was
seventy years old. What makes the <i>M'bo Ha-Yerushalmi</i>
particularly valuable is the circumstance that in it he broke
entirely new ground. It has, in fact, become an indispensable
guide to all who have chosen Talmudical literature
as their special study. In it Frankel displayed his usual
thoroughness in the critical analysis of its details, especially
of its many compilers, its peculiar language, and its relation
to the Babylonian Talmud.
</p>

<p>
The aims of Luzzatto and Frankel were in a large measure
identical. They appeared in the early part of the nineteenth
century when the presence of really able men was specially
needed in the Jewish camp. At that particular time it
<span class="pageno target" title="164" id="page-164"></span>
was fast becoming evident that unless Rabbinical and
other Jewish literature received an academical and classical
treatment it would sink into utter oblivion, and it is mainly
due to their exertions, both by the spoken word and the
published writing, that this misfortune was averted. Their
personal example moreover, in their capacity as heads of
Rabbinical seminaries, stimulated their pupils to embark
on original research into the various branches of Jewish
science and literature, and showed them at the same time
how to do it methodically and on scientific lines, with what
results latter-day history has sufficiently demonstrated.
</p>

<p>
Like Luzzatto, Frankel was actively engaged in literary
work till almost the very day of his death, which occurred
on February 23, 1875. He left no children of his own to
mourn him, but, as this essay is in its humble way intended
to show, he lives in the remembrance of his pupils, who
revered him as a teacher and loved him as a man.

<span class="subtitle">
<a href="#toc-return-XV">THE INFLUENCE OF HEBREW LITERATURE ON HEINRICH HEINE</a></span></h2>

<p>
<span class="begc">It</span> is curious to observe that Carlyle, who frequently
writes with unqualified admiration of the literary genius of
certain representatives of modern German literature, such
as Goethe, Schiller, and Jean Paul Richter, makes only one
brief reference to Heine. He there stigmatizes him with
even more than his usual savagery, “blackguard.” The
injustice of this obloquy has been amply proved by Heine's
popularity on both sides of the Atlantic among English-speaking
people.
</p>

<p>
A writer in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, some years ago, in
a lengthy article on Heine, said that his writings differed
from other works of the same nature in their bizarre and
grotesque style, as well as in the delightful humour with
which they often overflow—a humour vividly reminiscent
of Aristophanes. Heine, he goes on to say, who was a direct
descendant of the prophets in mind and inspiration, somewhat
resembled the two great seers of Israel—Isaiah and
Ezekiel. Like them, he found in the use of strange metaphors
and wonderful visions a ready means of appealing
to the imagination of his readers. The present essay is an
attempt to show that, in a spiritual sense, Heine really
had something in common with some of the great authors
of the Bible, whose peculiar style and beautiful diction he
instinctively imitated.
</p>

<p>
The first and most important question that arises is
naturally, Whether Heine had ever read the Bible or some
parts of it in the original Hebrew, or whether he acquired
his undoubtedly deep knowledge of it from a modern
version? Two of the greatest authorities, Graetz and
<span class="pageno target" title="166" id="page-166"></span>
Karpeles, say that Heine was sent in his early days by his
mother, Betty von Geldern, to a Jewish school, where he
actually learned some Hebrew, together with various other
subjects connected with the Jewish faith. However much
or little it was, Heine retained a vivid recollection of it to
the end, for in some of his later works are found some
Hebrew quotations, which are mainly short phrases and
sentences that occur in the Bible and in other Hebrew
volumes of a more modern date<a id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor"><sup>[166-1]</sup></a>.
</p>

<p>
But it was not only during the time he was at the Jewish
school at Düsseldorf that he had an opportunity of learning
certain important things about Judaism and its literature.
It is known that he was a keen member of a Jewish society
that was formed at Berlin in 1822 for the promotion of the
study and knowledge of Jewish history and literature; and
through his intimate acquaintance with several of the members,
such as Zunz, David Friedländer, Moser, and others,
Heine learnt to appreciate the charm of these studies. He
was enthusiastic in his praises of the Bible, and likewise
found in the poetry of the great Jewish poets of the Middle
Ages a perpetual source of delight. His knowledge of
them was derived from Michael Sach's well-known volume,
entitled <i>Die religiöse Poesie der Juden in Spanien</i>
(“Religious Poetry of the Jews in Spain”). Though his
inability to read the writings of Jehuda Halevi, Ibn
Gabirol, Moses and Meïr Ibn Ezra, and Alcharizi in the
original prevented him from an entire appreciation of their
merits, yet he speaks of them in his <i>Hebrew Melodies</i> in
terms of great admiration. Referring, for instance, to Alcharizi,
he says that he was a Voltaire six hundred years
before Voltaire lived; and of his special favourite Jehuda
Halevi, he says that he was kissed at his birth by the
Almighty, and that the sound of the kiss echoed in all his
poems and songs.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="167" id="page-167"></span>
</div>

<p>
There can be little doubt that his own works were influenced
in no small degree by these illustrious predecessors,
but it would seem that he was even more directly inspired
by the Bible itself, and particularly by the lyric songs,
which especially abound in the Book of Psalms and the
Song of Songs. He refers to it more than once in eulogistic
terms, but most characteristic are the following
remarks<a id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor"><sup>[167-1]</sup></a>: “I have to-day,” he writes, “again looked
through the Old Testament. What a marvellous book it
is! Its contents are wonderful, and so is its diction.
Every word it contains is as natural as the growing tree,
the smiling flower, the flowing ocean, the glittering star,
and the living man. The Bible is divine and emanates from
God, while all the other books in existence are but the poor
products of feeble-minded mortals. The Bible is the drama
of the human race, and may, moreover, be pronounced to be
the book of books—<i>Biblia</i>. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Jews ought, indeed, to
console themselves for the loss of Jerusalem and the Temple,
together with the Ark of the Covenant, and the precious
jewels of King Solomon; such a loss is surely quite insignificant
when compared with that indestructible treasure, the
Bible, which they have luckily saved. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My admiration
for it is extremely great.”
</p>

<p>
These were the views of Heine, the sceptic and the
mocker, who said, for instance, of Judaism, that it was not
a religion, but a misfortune. His early antipathy for his
religion may not improbably have been due to the repellent
effect, which the performance of a number of unattractive
and to him meaningless rites would naturally cause to
a man of his aesthetic sensibilities. But, as he grew older
and more serious in disposition, he looked upon Judaism
in a different light, and he changed his mockery into a
hymn of praise and admiration. He was deeply impressed
by the great antiquity of the Jewish race, which had
bravely withstood the shocks of time, and continued to live
<span class="pageno target" title="168" id="page-168"></span>
and to endure in spite of the many obstacles and hostile
influences to which it had been subjected. In his so-called
“Confessions,” written when he was already advanced in
years, he said that he felt proud of the fact that his
ancestors had been members of the noble house of Israel,
and that he was thus descended from those very martyrs,
who had given to the world a God and an admirable code
of ethics, for the sake of which they had often suffered
and died.
</p>

<p>
Heine's knowledge of Hebrew was, as already stated, by
no means so extensive as to make it credible that he had
of himself been able to detect in the poetical portions of the
Hebrew Bible certain beauties of form and diction, as well
as many of the graceful irregularities which constitute
a unique characteristic of their own. Yet he seems to
have had a sort of instinctive feeling for them. That such
singularities are also met with in many of Heine's lyric
songs is a fact that will hardly be disputed, though it is
uncertain whether they were really imitations of the
Biblical ones or not. At all events, they possess many of
the unique qualities which distinguish the poems in the
Hebrew Bible. They are characterized by a certain peculiarity
of rhythm, by their charming word-pictures, and
by their changes from gaiety to melancholy, from sobriety
to mirth. They have, moreover, supplied the theme for
many of the charming compositions of musicians, like
Schubert, Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, and Schumann. Further,
though they have been repeatedly translated into various
languages by some of the most eminent scholars of the
day, there is scarcely a single version which can be said
to preserve a reproduction of the spirit of the original. The
following two examples, which are English versions of
a Hebrew and German lyric song respectively, may be
considered sufficient to prove this. The Hebrew one occurs
in the Song of Songs (viii. 6 and 7), and its English
translation runs thus:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

The translation is by Sir Theodore Martin, whose
versions of many of Heine's poems and songs are generally
considered to be specially good, but it cannot truly be
said that in either of these two renderings is there much
more than the pale reflection of the charm of the original.
</p>

<p>
Again, it will be found that in the Biblical lyric songs
and those of Heine there is a striking community of sentiment,
<span class="pageno target" title="170" id="page-170"></span>
and more particularly in the idealization of womanhood
or of one of its fairest representatives. The following
translation (again by Sir Theodore Martin) of two songs of
Heine may serve as examples:—
</p>

</div>

<p>
Several poems of Heine, which are coloured with what
is called in modern phrase the “Weltschmerz,” show even
more clearly that their author has inherited something of
the sombre spirit of the prophets. Any one who has, for
instance, read the Book of Lamentations, or the 137th
Psalm beginning with the words “By the river of Babylon
there we sat down, and when we thought of Zion our tears
<span class="pageno target" title="171" id="page-171"></span>
did flow,” will hardly fail to detect an identity of feeling
in the fine verses of Heine on Zion. One of these poems
runs in the original German as follows:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Brich aus in tiefe Klagen,</p>
    <p class="verse">Du düsteres Martyrlied,</p>
    <p class="verse">Das ich so lang getragen</p>
    <p class="verse">Im flammenstillen Gemüth!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Es dringt in alle Ohren</p>
    <p class="verse">Und durch die Ohren ins Herz;</p>
    <p class="verse">Ich habe gewaltig geschworen</p>
    <p class="verse">Den tausendjährigen Schmerz.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Es weinen die Grossen und Kleinen,</p>
    <p class="verse">Sogar die alten Herr'n,</p>
    <p class="verse">Die Frauen und Blumen weinen,</p>
    <p class="verse">Es weinen am Himmel die Stern'.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">Und all die Thränen fliessen</p>
    <p class="verse">Nach Süden im stillen Verein,</p>
    <p class="verse">Sie fliessen und ergiessen</p>
    <p class="verse">Sich all in den Jordan hinein.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>
From the examples given it may be seen that whether
Heine sang the praises of his lady-love, or whether he
lamented the sad fate of his long-suffering people, he was
imbued with the same spirit which abode in the old
singers of Israel. Similarly he would seem to have gone
to the Bible for his inspiration when he took the wonders
of nature for his theme. If, for instance, the 104th and
the 107th Psalms, in which the moods of nature in her
opposite aspects are so effectively described, are compared
with those poems of Heine which deal with the same
subjects, it will readily be seen how close is the resemblance
between Heine and the Biblical models.
</p>

<p>
As in his poems so also in his sketches are found
extraordinary visions, which have, moreover, frequently
witty turnings. All these have something of Jewish Talmudism
about them, and are in the true Rabbinic vein.
Similar visions, fancies, and witticisms are common in
that section of the Talmud which is generally called the
<i>Agada</i>, wherein the grave Rabbis often enlivened their
<span class="pageno target" title="172" id="page-172"></span>
learned discussions with curious and fantastic tales, love-songs,
and sometimes even with facetious and satirical
digressions. From them, therefore, Heine seems to have
inherited much of the humour and incisive satire, which
he now and again employs as a weapon against his own
detractors and the enemies of the Jewish race.
</p>

<p>
Invested with something of a Jewish colouring are also
some of his epigrams, <i>bons mots</i>, and witty descriptions of
persons and things. Of these the following example may
serve as a specimen. Speaking of Fortune and Misfortune,
Heine offers the following amusing definitions: “Fortune,
or Good Luck,” he says, “is like a young and lively girl,
a relative of ours, who is staying with us on a visit. By
her unaffected merriment, sweet singing, and airy gossip
she makes her surroundings extremely happy, and her
presence is therefore hailed by us with much delight. But,
alas, she is, like a golden butterfly, flighty and restless, and
cares not much to abide in one place for any length of time.
Quite different, however, is Dame Misfortune, who may be
likened to an aged relative, and a spinster to boot, that
has a bitter look about her, and a sour temper. When
<i>she</i> is paying us a visit, she considers herself quite at home,
and would thus sit, and knit, and chatter, and moan, from
morning till night. Oh, how ardently we all long for her
speedy departure from among us; but she, for her part, is
fully determined to stay on and on, for ever and ever.”
</p>

<p>
Even on his death-bed Heine could not refrain from
a jest. Reviewing his by no means irreproachable past,
he said he hoped that his heavenly Father would readily
overlook his peccadillos, for <i>c'est son métier</i>. This remark
is typically Jewish, and it recalls a similar one once made
by a dying Rabbi, who had been all his lifetime extremely
religious, but had likewise always suffered much want and
misery. “Do you know,” he said to those in the sick
room, “if, after all the sad experiences I have had in the
past, there is no future life, I shall be greatly amused.”
</p>

<p>
There is still one further remark to be made in conclusion.
<span class="pageno target" title="173" id="page-173"></span>
While there is much that is fine, much that is genuinely
charming in Heine's work, it must be admitted that there
is also much in which he might be said to rival Rabelais
and Swift for licence. If any excuse for this be possible
it may, perhaps, be regarded as an extenuating circumstance
that he merely reproduced in his own language some faint
reminiscences from the contents of certain parts of the
Book of Ezekiel, of the Talmud, and the Midrash.

<a href="#toc-return-XVI">MODERN HEBREW JOURNALISM</a></span></h2>

<p>
<span class="begc">Hebrew</span> is generally considered to be, like ancient
Syriac, Arabic, Greek and Latin, a dead language, and yet
it possesses so much flexibility, and has, moreover, been
enriched in modern times with so many new words, phrases,
and expressions that it has in some respects almost become
modernized. There are at the present day, both in the
Old World and the New, quite a respectable number of
Hebrew periodicals, including a few daily papers, which
seem to enjoy considerable popularity and support among
a moderately large section of the Jewish reading public.
These constitute as a whole what may appropriately be
termed modern Hebrew journalism.
</p>

<p>
Modern Hebrew journalism has an interesting history of
its own, and likewise an intimate connexion with the rise
and development of Neo-Hebrew literature. It dates from
the time when the sage of Berlin, as Moses Mendelssohn
is commonly called, began to issue his epoch-making
German translation of the Pentateuch, which made its first
appearance in the year 1780. This translation was accompanied
by an excellent Hebrew introduction to the Bible,
or rather to the five books of Moses, entitled <i>O'r-La-netibah</i>
(<span class="heb" title="or lenetivah" xml:lang="he">אור לנתיבה</span>),
of which Mendelssohn was the author, and
likewise by an equally excellent commentary, now well
known under the name of <i>Biur</i>. Mendelssohn had several
eminent Hebraists for co-operators in the commentary,
among whom may specially be mentioned Hartwig Wessely,
the renowned composer of the fine heroic poem, <i>The
Mosaid</i>, called “Songs of Glory”
(<span class="heb" title="shir tipheret" xml:lang="he">שירי תפארת</span>).
The introduction
and commentary were both distinguished by their
<span class="pageno target" title="175" id="page-175"></span>
learning, as well as by the purity and freshness of their
style. They were thus a great advance on the earlier
criticisms, which were written in a Hebrew dialect that
was a mere mumbling of a decrepit tongue, and they
attained great popularity among the cultured community.
</p>

<p>
Among those who especially profited by these works were
two clever young Jewish students, called Isaac Euchel and
Mendel Bresselau. They had both enjoyed a Talmudical
and academical training, and were tutors in the house of
the wealthy and cultured Friedländers, residing in Königsberg,
in Prussia, which city in those days stood in close
literary relationship to the Prussian capital. These young
men, in 1782, resolved, in the interests of Hebrew literature;
to invite all the representative and cultured Jews in the
world to help to found and to support a Hebrew periodical,
the title of which was to be <i>The Gatherer</i>
(<span class="heb" title="hameassef" xml:lang="he">המאסף</span>). This
invitation was readily accepted by many educated Jews
living in Germany, Austria, Holland, France, Italy, Russia
and Poland. Thus encouraged they set to work, and soon
issued the first number of <i>The Gatherer</i>, which was the
progenitor of modern Hebrew journalism. This number
contained a variety of articles written almost exclusively
in Hebrew, the most notable of which were two biographical
sketches, one dealing with Don Isaac Abrabanel (1437–1509),
and the other with Joseph del Medigo (1591–1655).
There were also a few charming Hebrew poems, including
some anonymously contributed by Moses Mendelssohn,
and the well-known Hebrew wine-song by Solomon Ibn
Gabirol. Wessely contributed an article on Biblical exegesis,
a subject which had been sadly neglected by the
Jews of that period. <i>The Gatherer</i> thus started under
happy auspices. It had been a bond of union between
Judaism and modern culture, so much so that some Christians
of note saw in it a powerful medium for educating
the general mass of the Jewish people.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Gatherer</i> continued to be issued for fourteen years
(from 1783–97), during which time it numbered among its
<span class="pageno target" title="176" id="page-176"></span>
contributors, in addition to those already mentioned, several
other masters of Hebrew style, among whom may specially
be mentioned Isaac Satanow, Ben-Zeeb, Joel Löwe, Aaron
Halle, Moses Ensheim, and David Franco Mendes, the
author of the Hebrew historical drama <i>Gemul Athalia</i>
(“The Punishment of Athalia”).
</p>

<p>
After its demise, nearly a quarter of a century elapsed
before another Hebrew periodical of the same stamp made
its appearance. This was called <i>Bikkurey Ha-Ittim</i> (“The
Firstling of the Times”), and was started in Vienna (in
1820) by an able Hebraist, named Shalom Ha-Cohen. It
had some of the most eminent Hebrew scholars of the day
among its regular contributors, including Rapoport, Luzzatto,
and Erter, the former of whom published therein five
biographies of prominent leaders of Judaism of the Middle
Ages, which gave an important impulse to the study of
Neo-Hebraic literature. Erter, the greatest of Hebrew
humorists of modern times, contributed some of his delightful
sketches of Jewish life in the Ghetto.
</p>

<p>
After about twelve years the <i>Bikkurey Ha-Ittim</i> ceased
to appear, but a little later another annual Hebrew magazine
was first issued by Goldenberg, and then by Senior
Sachs, in Vienna and Prague respectively, having <i>Kerem
Chemed</i> (“The Pleasant Vineyard”) for its title. This publication
was, like its two predecessors, largely devoted to
the promotion of the Hebrew language and literature, but
its principal interest was the study of Jewish history,
which had been generally neglected before. Its chief contributors
were Rapoport, Zunz, and Luzzatto, the last-named
of whom published therein several valuable extracts
from rare Hebrew MSS. The <i>Kerem Chemed</i> was, with
regard to its learned contents and the purity of its style,
one of the best Hebrew periodicals that has ever existed,
but it only appeared for a period of ten years, viz. from
1833 to 1843.
</p>

<p>
Noticeable also are the <i>Otzer Nechmad</i> (“The Desirable
Treasure”), which was edited for a short time in Vienna by
<span class="pageno target" title="177" id="page-177"></span>
Ignatz Blumenfeld, and had Dukes, Geiger, Steinschneider,
Luzzatto, Carmoly, and Kirchheim as contributors; the
<i>Kochbey Yitzchak</i> (“The Stars of Isaac”), issued for several
years by M. E. Stern, of Vienna; and the <i>Jeshurun</i>, of
which the editor, Joseph Kobak, of Lemberg, only published
four insignificant numbers at irregular intervals. But it
cannot be said that their influence on Neo-Hebrew literature
had been very extensive. There were, however, two
other magazines, which, having some special characteristics
of their own, and being, moreover, of permanent literary
value, are deserving of more than a passing notice.
</p>

<p>
One of them was started (in 1852) in Vienna by O. H.
Schorr, under the title of <i>Ha-Chalutz</i> (“The Armed One”),
and it counted among its contributors Krochmal, Geiger,
Zunz, Steinschneider, and Erter. Though chiefly dealing
with the history of Jewish literature, the <i>Chalutz</i> was, as
its title indicates, a Hebrew periodical with radical tendencies,
advocating extensive reforms in the Jewish ritual.
The editor himself, a highly learned man, devoted several
articles to a consideration of certain abuses and superstitions
found in some of the Rabbinical writings, by which
pure Judaism was thought to have been disfigured. The
essays were distinguished by the vigour of their tone, their
caustic humour, and their amusing irony, and have served
as a model to more than one writer of modern Hebrew
prose.
</p>

<p>
The other was called <i>Ha-Shachar</i> (“The Dawn”), and
made its first appearance in Vienna in 1868, under the
editorship of Peter (or Perets) Smolensky, an excellent
writer of classical Hebrew prose. His own sketches were
remarkable both for humour and pathos, and have a certain
ring of Thackeray about them. Among the contributors
to <i>The Dawn</i> may be noted Rapoport, Jellinek, and
Juda Löb Gordon (1830–92). The latter was an excellent
poet and humorist, whose collected Hebrew verses were
published in 1884 by Baron Ginsburg, of St. Petersburg,
in memory of their deceased author. Several of them
<span class="pageno target" title="178" id="page-178"></span>
had previously appeared in <i>The Dawn</i>, and as they are
pretty and rich in humour the following free prose translation
of one of them may serve here as an appropriate
specimen. It has a highly orthodox Russian Rabbi for its
subject, and runs as follows:—
</p>

<p>
“On a sultry Sabbath afternoon a middle-aged Rabbi
was sitting in his study dozing over a large folio of the
Talmud. Suddenly an extremely religious member of his
flock rushed in full of excitement, and told him that a
Jewish lad had just been caught in the act of desecrating
the holy Sabbath by carrying a watch in the open street.
On hearing this shocking news the Rabbi gave orders that
the young culprit should at once be brought into his
presence, that he might receive his well-deserved chastisement
for openly breaking one of the Rabbinical laws.
When the boy was brought in, the Rabbi looked at him,
and lo and behold! he was no other than his own little
son, who had furtively gone into the street, carrying in his
waistcoat pocket the watch which had been given to him
as a ‘Bar-Mitzwah<a id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor"><sup>[178-1]</sup></a>’ present. The Rabbi was for a moment
rather perplexed, but soon a happy thought struck him,
and turning abruptly to the excited crowd of bystanders,
he addressed them as follows:—‘Rabbothay’ (gentlemen),
he said, ‘I have just come to the conclusion that my boy
is guiltless of the charge you have brought against him.
For, had you been as well versed in the Rabbinical writings
as I am, you would have known that a watch is but an
ornament, which is allowed to be worn by a Jew or a Jewess
on a Sabbath day even in the open street. Thus my boy
had only done what was right, and therefore deserves no
punishment whatever.’ When the people left the Rabbi's
house, a wit among them observed to his neighbour, with
a sly twinkle in his eye, that their ‘Rav’ was a cunning
man, indeed, and knew how to turn matters to his own
advantage, or to that of his near relatives. Thus, when
a son-in-law of his ordered a cargo of citrons from Corfu,
<span class="pageno target" title="179" id="page-179"></span>
the ‘Rav’ forbade the members of his flock on the Feast of
Tabernacles to use citrons grown in Palestine; and he also
interdicted them from buying any ordinary wine after one
of his married daughters had opened a shop for the sale of
cheap raisin wine.”
</p>

<p>
As regards the numerous Hebrew periodicals, which
appear in different parts of the world, it is enough to say
that, although they are not without merit, it is impossible
within the limits of a short sketch to do more than mention
a few of the more important. Three of them are here
selected as being specially worthy of note, on account of
the fruitful work which they have done and are still doing
in various ways in the field of Hebrew literature. The
first to be considered are the three or four volumes issued
annually at Berlin (under the editorship of Prof. Dr. A.
Berliner) by the society <i>Mekitze-Nirdamim</i>, these being
most useful literary publications, though perhaps not exactly
periodicals. This society has, for instance, during
the last few years brought out all the admirable religious
and secular poems of Jehudah Halevi<a id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor"><sup>[179-1]</sup></a>.
</p>

<p>
Equally useful and interesting is a monthly Hebrew
periodical, entitled <i>Ha-Shiloach</i> (“The Messenger”), which
was established in Berlin about eight years ago by Asher
Ginsberg, of Odessa. A good many articles have a permanent
literary value; others again, though less scientific,
are written in such excellent Hebrew that, like Erter's
works, they may be re-read with no diminution of pleasure.
</p>

<p>
The third Hebrew periodical that deserves special notice
is <i>Ha-Magid</i> (“The Narrator”), which has, however, lately
ceased to exist. It was started about half a century ago
(in 1856) at Lyck, in Prussia, by the late L. Silbermann,
Rabbi of the Hebrew congregation of that town, who
issued it weekly with the laudable object of affording
<span class="pageno target" title="180" id="page-180"></span>
entertainment and information on general topics to those
of his co-religionists, who were unable to read papers published
in the vernacular<a id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor"><sup>[180-1]</sup></a>. The number of Jews of this
description was, fifty years ago, fairly large, but has now,
thanks to the spread of general education, been greatly
reduced. Several Jewish <i>literati</i> used to contribute articles,
and the paper had in consequence gradually become a
medium for propagating a knowledge of Hebrew literature
among its numerous readers. Since then the Hebrew
vocabulary has been greatly developed and amplified in
such a manner as to be capable of describing not only the
newest move in the politics of the world, but also the
latest invention in the field of practical science. It is
interesting to notice that there are at present three Hebrew
daily papers in circulation in Russia, viz. <i>Ha-Yom</i>, <i>Ha-Meliz</i>,
and <i>Ha-Zefira</i>, which were founded respectively by
L. Kantor, A. Zedernbaum, and C. Slonimsky.
</p>

<p>
Summarizing now the merits of modern Hebrew journalism
it may be said that they are far greater than is
generally supposed. In fact, it has exercised a beneficial
and far-reaching influence upon a large section of the
Jewish community. For, not only has it enriched Hebrew
literature with valuable additions, but it has also familiarized
its readers, through the medium of translations, with
some of the best-known ancient and modern works on
general science and literature.

<h2>Transcriber's note:</h2>

<p>
The original spelling of the book has been retained, even when wrong
(Bosone da Gobbio [<i>Gubbio</i>], <a href="#Bezalu">Bezalu, near Perpignon</a>
[<i>Besalú, near Perpignan</i>]), or variant (Juda/Jehuda/Jehudah
Halevi/Halevy).  The original transliteration of Hebrew words, which
does not always follow uniform rules, has been preserved.
Similarly, inaccurate quotations (e.g.
<a href="#Falstaff">Falstaff's remark</a> “I
told <del>you</del> John a Gaunt...”) were not rectified.
</p>
